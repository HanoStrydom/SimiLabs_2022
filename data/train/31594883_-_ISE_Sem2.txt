1	Introduction 
In this research assignment, various project management and development methodologies will be investigated to determine which methodologies are the most used in the South African IT industry compared to international industries. The methodology needs to satisfy and support the development team during software application development to address stakeholders' needs. 
Shehzad et al. (2017) state that the rapid expansion of the software development industry is due to the exponential increase in universal demand for software applications by consumers in their daily activities. Angel et al. (2022) argue that the expanding usage of techniques in project development gave rise to the concept of a comparative study on project management and software development processes. Software development approaches are a group of techniques that must be combined to produce a methodical process, and development approaches have changed over time to reflect the times and new technologies. 
2	Problem Statement
The main problem that this research paper will aim to address is to explore the various software development methodologies and Project Management Methodology used locally by various companies to determine the most popular methodologies and how they compare to those used on an international level. This study will also consider how the Covid-19 pandemic has influenced and shaped software development methodologies and Project Management Methodologies and how we can adapt and stay ahead of these changes.
There are many different Software Development (SD) - and Project Management (PM) methodologies, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Each SDM and PMM is built on its distinct concepts and supports the many various domains across the development lifecycle. The benefits of employing an SDM and PMM outweigh its dangers and shortcomings, making it a vital component that significantly contributes to the success of a development cycle.
3	Literature study
This literature study will focus on information on the various Project Management Methodology and software development methodologies, as well as some of their strong and weak points, in order to provide a general understanding of the methodologies companies use and how future scenarios can influence the choice of Project Management Methodology and software development methodologies.
3.1	Agile 
3.1.1	What is Agile development?
Agile is a broad term for a set of software development principles. It is a theoretical framework for software engineering that starts with the planning stage and progresses through incremental and iterative interactions throughout the project's lifecycle until the deployment stage. Agile approaches' initial objective is to reduce overhead in the software development process while enabling the adoption of changes without endangering the process or requiring excessive rework .
3.1.2	Agile values and principles
The Agile Software Development manifesto provides the following values and principles to which Agile development should adhere and strive for:
3.1.2.1	Values
1)	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:
The first value in the manifesto suggests that it is incorrect to emphasise abstract formal processes and their technical environment as essential factors in software development. Instead, communication, interaction, and the calibre of the human software developers that these factors serve should be prioritised.

2)	Working software over comprehensive documentation:
Although documentation is an essential and significant part of any agile software development process, the time and resources allocated must be managed and streamlined so as not to stifle the software development process.

3)	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:
The purpose of agile software development is to adapt to changes in requirements at any stage. As a result, throughout any process, frequent customer feedback, negotiations, and collaboration with the development team are necessary to meet the customers' actual needs as opposed to those that can be satisfied through formal agreements and contracts. However, the agreements that detail how the software firm operates and the connection between the development team and its clients are still necessary.

4)	Responding to change over following a plan:
Adding or removing some criteria may be required as the software development process moves forward since both the developer and the customers will gain more knowledge and a deeper understanding of the system. Since achieving customer happiness is the ultimate objective, responding to changes in the development process life cycle is given priority in the Agile manifesto rather than adhering to a rigidly defined plan.

3.1.2.2	Scrum 
Scrum is a methodology that enables people to work productively and creatively to deliver products with the highest potential value while addressing complex adaptive problems (Scrum, 2022).


3.1.2.2.1	Scrum Framework
Scrum is a simple framework that assists individuals, groups, and organisations produce value by developing adaptable solutions to challenging issues. The Scrum Guide, written by the co-creators of Scrum Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, provides a clear and concise explanation of Scrum. The definition of Scrum can be found in this guide. Accountabilities, events, artefacts, and the rules that bring them all together make up this description of Scrum (Scrum, 2022).

Scrum is the antithesis of a large group of interconnected required components. The Scrum approach is not one. Empiricism is a scientific method that Scrum uses. Scrum uses a heuristic approach, respect for people, and self-organisation to deal with unpredictability and solve complicated problems instead of a programmed algorithmic one. The illustration below shows Scrum in Action as it is taught by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland in their book Software in 30 Days, which covers the entire software development lifecycle (Scrum, 2022 ).
 
3.1.3	Agile development compared to traditional development

	Traditional Development	Agile Development
Fundamental assumptions	Systems are fully specifiable and predictable and are built through meticulous and extensive planning	High-quality adaptive software is developed by small teams using the principles of continuous design improvement and testing based on rapid feedback and change
Management style	Explicit	Tacit
Communication	Formal	Informal
Development model	Lifecycle model (waterfall, spiral or some variation)	The evolutionary-delivery model
Desired organisational form/structure	Mechanistic (bureaucratic with high formalisation), aimed at large organisations	Organic (flexible and participative encouraging cooperative social action), aimed at small and medium-sized organisations
Quality control	Heavy planning and strict control. Late, heavy testing	Continuous control of requirements, design and solutions. Continuous testing
Table 1 Comparison between traditional development and Agile Development (Scrum, 2022) 

3.1.4	Strong points
Shahir et al. (2008) state that agile software development has the following strength points:
 
1.	Promotes change
Change is viewed as an ally rather than an adversary, and the change enables more creativity and faster consumer value. Highsmith, cited by Shahir et al. (2008), argues that Agile approaches are well suited to projects with a high degree of task variety.

2.	Satisfying stakeholders and users
When stakeholders are included in the development team, their perspectives are considered when decisions are made, which often reduces the need for later rework. On the other hand, users consider themselves a part of the development team when their opinions are valued, and they are more likely to completely commit to moving the project forward.

3.	Test-Driven
Most Agile approaches prioritise coding and testing over research and design, to the point that many Agile methodologies develop test cases and test code before the real release begins. The key benefits of test-based coding include greater code maintainability, fewer inconsistencies, and better quality assurance.

4.	Refactoring
Refactoring is required and inevitable in Agile processes due to some of the distinguishing qualities of Agile approaches, such as their focus on code rather than design, the necessity for dynamicity and circulation of team members, and the demand for a highly flexible product. The major goals of refactoring in this context are to remove redundant and unneeded code, increase code simplicity, achieve flexibility without changing the system's functionality, and improve developer communication .
Shubh and Gandhi (2012) further asserts more strength points of agile software development:
1.	Requirements Inflation
In traditional software development technologies, the numerous elements that are not identified at the start of the project endanger estimations and timetables for project progress. Rather than using change-prevention techniques, prioritisation sessions are scheduled to enable implementation of worthwhile modifications and previously planned features to be replaced if the business approves.

2.	Early benefits to the user/business
Agile technique provides an early glimpse of how the final product will seem and function, which aids in completing the user requirements.

3.	Regaining the productivity of development
When project schedules extend for a long period, the sense of urgency to work is often lacking, resulting in time lost in the early stages of the project that can never be recovered. Agile techniques understand Parkinson's Law and the Student Syndrome in software projects. Work is time-boxed into reasonable iterations, and there is always a sense of urgency, thanks to short iterations.

4.	Reduction of Employee "Bus-Factor"
In the traditional model, the departure of essential employees from the project team with vital information delays project development. To reduce the "bus factor," agile projects employ approaches such as common code ownership, pair programming, and frequent reporting during daily stand-ups, among others. The "bus factor" refers to the impact on the project if a key member is hit by a bus. Multiple team members communicate critical information when the "bus factor" is low, and the risk of staff turnover is minimal.

5.	Elimination of Inherent scheduled flaws
Software development is notoriously difficult to predict and schedule at first. When it comes to software projects, however, the team is strongly involved in planning and estimation through activities like the XP planning game. Working in short increments reveals the team's actual velocity, which is evident to all stakeholders who are now more invested in the project.

6.	Conflicting requirements breakdown
The idea of subject matter expert, ambassador user, or customer proxy is used in agile projects to play the function of product manager. The concept is that the group must be immediately available to answer inquiries and make project decisions, whereas traditional projects suffer from specification breakdown when no one owns the role and opposing assumptions or conclusions are made. Agile projects have some product owner roles integral to their core team structure to ensure that decisions are made on time.
3.1.5	Weak points
The following section will discuss some of the various weak points, as argued by Shubh and Gandhi (2012):
1.	Not fully understanding the difference
The primary issue is that genuine Agile is hardly performed. Software engineers, development managers, and consultants frequently confuse Agile with its lowercase twin, agile, and believe that Agile is all about flexibility and lack of process. Above all, Agile is not anarchy. Despite what you may believe, it does not mean that everyone does anything they want and that there is no sense of organisation.

2.	Possibility of re-writing code during development
Rework is frequently required in agile projects when the program's many components are combined and forced to interact due to a lack of long-term planning and a lightweight approach to architecture. When two or more developers are out of sync, chunks of code may need to be re-written, resulting in increased and higher rework expenses as the number of iterations grow.

3.	The reliance on customer interaction
Heavy Customer Interaction is one of the main benefits of Agile, but it can also be a drawback in specific circumstances, as reflected in the four principles. One thing to keep in mind about agile development teams is that they require a lot of attention.

4.	Insufficient architectural planning
Before the heart of the software is produced, dependable software architecture and platform are chosen. Otherwise, there is a good probability that much labour will be wasted. Many larger companies isolate software architecture and platform selection from software development via corporate architecture and architectural roadmaps, which relieves the agile software team of some of the work. On the other hand, the agile software strategy will oppose defining and dealing with architecture if the platform is unknown prior to the start of the project and the architectural approach is new or unproven.

5.	Difficulty in coordination for large projects and organisations
As an agile team grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to coordinate work due to its strong emphasis on contact, self-organising client teams, vocal communication over written documentation, prototyping, and requirements flexibility.

In continuation, Shahir et al. (2008) state the following additional weak points:
1.	Ineffective communication and interaction methods
Face-to-face contact is the most common sort of interaction in Agile techniques. Although other forms of communication are utilised to discuss ideas, the lack of models and recorded design leaves insufficient references in the event of conflicts or forgetting.

2.	Global or distributed development obstacles
Members of the development team work in close proximity to one another in Agile techniques, and some processes even need the entire team to be in the same room or building. Face-to-face contact, daily and weekly meetings, and human interactions all play an important part in the effectiveness of such operations.

3.	High dependency on the development team
Agile approaches are more people-oriented than process-oriented, as stated in the Agile Manifesto. As a result, circumstances arise in which teamwork issues become more challenging than they should be.

4.	Misestimating Project time and budget
Agile principles allow for frequent modifications to requirements; however, this affects project time and cost estimation. Furthermore, calculating the workload is challenging owing to the lack of modelling and design processes. In the lack of analytical class diagrams, for example, the number of classes to be implemented is frequently unknown until later. As a result, project managers cannot plan effectively, and project plans must be revised frequently.


3.2	COBIT 2019 Framework 
The following section is based on the information found within the COBIT 2019 Framework of Governance and Management Objectives.
Best-practice frameworks have been established and advocated over time to aid in the understanding, designing, and implementing enterprise IT governance. COBIT 2019 expands on and integrates more than 25 years of research and development in this sector, incorporating new scientific discoveries and operationalising these ideas as practice.
COBIT is a globally recognised set of tools that directors and IT specialists may use to guarantee that IT operations align with business objectives and goals (Zhang & Le Fever, 2013). 
COBIT is an enterprise-wide framework for the governance and management of information and technology. Governance and management are clearly separated in the COBIT framework. These two fields include separate activities, necessitate different organisational structures, and have different goals.
•	Governance will promote the following:
o	To define balanced, agreed-upon enterprise objectives, the needs, conditions, and options of stakeholders are examined in detail.
o	Prioritisation and decision-making provide direction.
o	Performance and compliance are assessed in relation to agreed-upon goals and objectives.
•	To achieve enterprise objectives, management plans, builds, runs, and oversees activities in accordance with the governance body's instructions.
o	Management in most businesses is the duty of executive management, which is led by the chief executive officer (CEO).
COBIT outlines the processes, organisational structures, rules and procedures, information flows, culture and behaviours, skills, and infrastructure that goes into constructing and maintaining a governance system. COBIT describes the design factors that an organisation should consider when constructing a best-fit governance system. COBIT solves governance problems by collecting key governance components into governance and management objectives that can be controlled to the required competency levels.
3.2.1	Structure of COBIT Governance and Management Objectives
COBIT 2019 has 40 governance and management objectives divided into five areas, as previously stated.
•	Governance domain
•	Evaluate, Direct and Monitor (EDM)
•	Management domains
•	Align, Plan and Organise (APO) – Information and Technology's (I&T) general organisation, strategy, and supporting operations are addressed.
•	Build, Acquire and Implement (BAI) - Defines, acquires and implements I&T solutions and their integration into business operations.
•	Deliver, Service and Support (DSS) - Security, as well as the operational delivery and support of I&T services.
Monitor, Evaluate and Assess (MEA) - examines I&T performance and compliance with internal performance targets, internal control objectives, and external obligations.

3.2.2	Strengths 
The following section will discuss the benefits of using the COBIT 2019 framework, as argued by Gallagher (2020)
1.	Optimised IT governance
COBIT 2019 assists firms in establishing measurable IT objectives as part of larger business plans. COBIT practitioners may also set up the essential controls and tools to assist IT, managers, in achieving their goals with the full force behind their operations. A variety of tools are included in the methodology to assist with this, including:
•	The COBIT maturity model can be used to determine the level of performance that IT components must achieve in order to accomplish goals.
•	Enhancing activities, which the ISACA recommends for identifying and removing flaws and limiting factors in COBIT implementations.

2.	Alignment between IT and business goals
There are a total of 40 Management and Governance Objectives in the COBIT core model. Practitioners study this extensive collection to select focal areas based on their own objectives, needs, and environment, among other factors. They can then create custom frameworks that are tailored to their vision of optimal IT governance.

3.	Customisable to suit your priorities
COBIT 2019 is ideal for organisations that already employ IT techniques. COBIT's 'Tactical Design Factors' is tailored to a user's preferences for technologies, models, and frameworks to utilise in their operations. Practitioners can use these variables to create systems that accept such aspects while also maximising their coherence and synergy.

3.2.3	Weaknesses
The following section will discuss practical problems encountered when utilising COBIT, as stated by Zhang and Le Fever (2013).
1.	Complicated concepts and structure
Various professionals and specialists within the field have acknowledged that understanding the COBIT framework is not an easy task. The framework is massive and consists of numerous objectives, goals, guidelines, and even a maturity model. To fully understand everything contained in the framework takes a long time. 

2.	Lack of implementation guidance and proven benefits
COBIT's general character makes it challenging for corporations to comprehend and implement. Although the COBIT Management Instructions and Implementation Guidelines state that COBIT must be tailored to a given environment, they do not offer tangible ways or guidelines to help firms. Even though it was evident that a COBIT programme should be implemented, several executives agreed that they would instead focus on ITIL and ISO27000, which had a higher value.
3.3	PMBOK
The following section is based on information found within the Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, written by the Project Management Institute. 
The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) is a collection of accepted terms and principles for project management. A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide), a book whose seventh edition was published in 2021, presents the body of knowledge as it develops through time. The Project Management Institute (PMI), which grants the CAPM and PMP credentials, oversaw the creation of this document. Much of the PMBOK Guide, including the critical path technique and work breakdown structure, is specific to project management. 
The PMBOK Guide broadly discusses general management in terms of organising, staffing, executing, and regulating an organisation's operations. Financial forecasting, organisational behaviour, management science, budgeting, and other planning techniques are some other management disciplines that cross over with the PMBOK Guide.
Project managers and other stakeholders who work on or are involved with projects are guided in their actions and behaviours by the project management standard's project management principles. Understanding project management and how it supports desired objectives is made easier by the Project Management Standard. Any industry, location, size, or distribution strategy—such as predictive, hybrid, or adaptive—can use this standard. It describes the organisational structure of projects, including governance, potential roles, the project environment, and worries about the relationship between project-product management.
The following SWOT section is based on information asserted by Buehring (2021)
3.3.1	Strengths
The PMBOK Guide's key strength is that it offers many valuable tools and procedures. There are 132 tools and techniques detailed or mentioned in all. Although the PMBOK guide loosely describes many of the tools and techniques, the main attraction is that the PMBOK Guide asserts when these various tools and techniques should be utilised during project management. Another advantage is that the PMBOK Guide's knowledge categories can be dealt with independently. In many cases of uncertainty, the PMBOK Guide provides extensive information on specific generic areas that will be encountered, such as communication management and schedule management.

3.3.2	Weaknesses
One of the PMBOK Guide's flaws is the absence of clear responsibilities for project management team members. This broad term refers to project team members who are directly involved in project management tasks. The problem with the PMBOK Guide's approach is that many of these obligations may be overlooked simply because who is responsible is not clearly specified. The extremely elaborate and extensive descriptions of some of the aspects are a second flaw. Complexity is always a burden, not an aid, and as previously stated, anecdotal evidence suggests that the PMBOK Guide is not helping itself in this area. The PMBOK Guide, developed by North American authors, is written entirely from a North American perspective and does not always translate well to other cultures.
4	Case Study
To accurately satisfy the research question, I case study was conducted, where a questionnaire was utilised and distributed to various software development companies in South Africa. The company employees answered the questionnaire, each with different roles and responsibilities. This approach will aid in accumulating the necessary information to deduce various results which will be displayed in tables and graphs below. The companies that were chosen to partake in the questionnaire were selected broadly and flexibly. Each company has a unique number of employees and focuses on different areas of work. This ensures that the information utilised is well-rounded and a good representation of the industry. The questions asked within the case study are focused on the impact that Covid-19 has had on employees and the company.

The questionnaire results supplied by the Sedibeng Districts offices provided some insights into which Project Management Methodologies are used and how Covid-19 has affected a branch of government. No software development takes place within the department. Although no development takes place, the branch still focuses on IT-related projects within the government. The Sedibeng Districts Municipality is a medium entity with a total number of employees ranging from 101-500. The employee role of the interviewee is IT Operations Manager. The principal project management methodology utilised at the Sedibeng Districts Offices is PMBOK.

5	Analysis
The following analysis is based on the data received from the questionnaires answered by the companies discussed above.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the office experience of various developers and managers has shifted to a work-from-home environment. From meetings being held on zoom, to various phases of the development cycle being completed at home. As a result of more work being completed outside of company premises, various processes and guidelines are influenced by these factors and require a re-evaluation of how these methodologies function within a post-COVID-19 world.

 
Table 2 Impact of COVID-19 on organisations
 
Table 3 Impact of COVID-19 on Project Management
 
Table 4 Impact of COVID-19 on Software Development

 
Table 5 Positive impact results of COVID-19
In reference to Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5, we can see that there is a clear indication that employees feel that COVID-19 has impacted their organisations. Most employees feel that COVID-19 has influenced how project management and software development is conducted. The most interesting finding was that although COVID-19 has significantly influenced companies, employees seem to feel that COVID-19 has positively affected the company . Table 5 consists of the total results of all the COVID-19 questions relating to a positive experience. We can see that many employees feel that COVID-19 has had a positive influence on project management, software development and general work/life experience.

 
Table 6 Software Development Methodologies utilised
In reference to table 6, which consists of the results concerning the software development methodologies used by companies, we can see that majority of companies, regardless of size and field of work, prefer to utilise the many different Agile methodology variations.
 
Table 7 Project Management Methodology utilised
In reference to table 7, which consists of the results concerning the Project Management Methodology used by companies, we can see that most companies utilise Agile as their Project Management Methodology in conjunction with Agile as their software development methodology. Interestingly, most employees stated that they can see a difference between Agile as a software development methodology and Agile as a project management methodology.
 
Table 8 Workload completed at company offices
In reference to table 8, which consists of results in relation to which location employees completed their work, we can see that before COVID-19 much of the work was completed on-site. When COVID-19 began, we can see that most employees started working from home or a different location, and after COVID-19 ended, we can see that most of the employees returned to the office. Although, the results show that more work is being done from a different location than the company offices.
Considering all the results, we can conclude that COVID-19 has had a significant impact on employee work life, location of work, company software development methodologies, company Project Management Methodology, and the company's inner workings. Although all is not lost because most employees believe to some extent that COVID-19 has positively influenced their companies and working experience.
The questionnaire results show that Agile is the most popular among Project Management Methodology and software development methodologies, although the specific type of Agile methodology used might be different, the core concepts and values are still the same. As stated within the literature study, Agile is highly dependent on communication. COVID-19 has eliminated the possibility of meeting face-to-face with employees and clients which has played a large role in the way we communicate. Various communication tools have risen to aid with scenarios such as COVID-19. Agile can continue to be used during scenarios such as COVID-19 if the company successfully and effectively communicates with their employees via the various software that has been released in recent years.


6	Conclusion
The utilisation of Project Management Methodology and software development methodologies is essential for the successful development of projects. Various project management methodologys and SDMs are based on different principles, each contributing to each methodology's uniqueness, techniques, and processes. The most utilised PROJECT MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGY and SDM is the combined use of Agile for both PROJECT MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGY and SDM. Agile remains fairly?? popular and will remain popular in the coming years. In the event that another COVID-19 scenario occurs, the successful utilisation of a methodology such as Agile will be highly dependent on the company's ability to effectively and efficiently communicate with employees outside of the office.

I’m a bit lost with the discussion section. Where does Cobit, ITIL and ISO fit in. Your discussion of the research findings was good.
