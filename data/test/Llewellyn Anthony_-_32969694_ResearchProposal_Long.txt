Introduction

The purpose of this study is to obtain knowledge on how to read sensory input from an Arduino R3 Uno as a stream and send it to a streaming platform (Kafka is preferable in this study). To undertake data analysis, the data must be translated into a pivot-table format and displayed on a dashboard (preferably Desktop Tableau) after it has been stored on the platform. Based on the results of the tableau, one must be able to make certain business decisions as a result of the analysis. Thus, the study focuses on the design and implementation of an artefact that can receive sensory input, store data received as streams and display the results in a tableau in order to perform analytics. Experiences and observations should be documented and used as recommendations for designing and implementing an IoT system, as well as providing insights into how to approach difficulties from a different perspective. Sections that will follow is a background of the study, which provides an overview of the existing literature that concerns this study, as well as a description and goals of this study. The problem statement provides a more in-depth overview of the study and what problems this study aims to solve. The paradigmatic perspective mentions the research paradigm applicable to this study and its essence. Methods within the paradigmatic perspective will be discussed that helps to conduct research. Aims and objectives of the study will be discussed: the main goals of the study and tasks that flows from the main goals. The research methodology implemented in the study will be discussed, wherein the artefact and lifecycle of the project is a key aspect. Methods on how to sample data and conduct research will be discussed. The approach to project management and the project plan involves the scope, limitations and risks associated with the study. The project plan will be a Gantt Chart that lists activities/tasks that needs to be completed during the entire lifecycle of the project. A provisional chapter division will be provided that provides the framework for the literature study. Finally, an executive summary will be provided that provides an overall “conclusion” of the study.

Background to study

In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) concept has been widely adopted within a variety of disciplines, ranging from the industry to smart cities (Calvillo-Arbizu et al., 2021:1). In the health sector, IoT enables new healthcare delivery scenarios as well as the collecting and analysis of real-time health data via sensors so that better judgments can be made on how to solve health issues (Calvillo-Arbizu et al., 2021:1). This sector, however, is complex and involves a number of technological obstacles (Calvillo-Arbizu et al., 2021:1). Despite the abundant literature on the subject, IoT applications in healthcare just scratch the surface of the sector's needs (Calvillo-Arbizu et al., 2021:1). The majority of IoT technologies are multipurpose and must be customized to meet the specific needs of each industry (Calvillo-Arbizu et al., 2021:1). These requirements are frequently overlooked in health IoT-driven solutions, and there happens to be no systematic evaluation of the burgeoning literature from the standpoint of health IoT-driven solutions (Calvillo-Arbizu et al., 2021:1).

As indicated by Calvillo-Arbizu et al. (2021:4), extensive research and material does exist on IoT topics, specifically the healthcare sector. A total of 12108 items were found after searching databases (Calvillo-Arbizu et al., 2021:4). After the process of removing duplicates (3 602 papers), the remaining literature were sorted by title (5 934 papers) and abstract (2 376 papers were excluded) (Calvillo-Arbizu et al., 2021:4). The contents of the resulting papers were examined in order to identify literature studies that were beyond the scope of the sector (Calvillo-Arbizu et al., 2021:4). Out of all the resulting articles, 86 were found to be eligible for review (Calvillo-Arbizu et al., 2021:4). Although extensive research on IoT topics exists, literature studies on the design and implementation of IoT and streamed data applications are limited and the complexity of IoT systems restricts potential applications, and rarely current IoT solutions gets deployed real-time (Calvillo-Arbizu et al., 2021:8).

Based on the abovementioned literature study, this study examines how to receive sensory input from an Arduino R3 Uno and read the input as a stream to the Kafka streaming platform and identify and demonstrate an area of application. Gaps in the healthcare industry might have to be researched, and the artefact should contribute to fill the gap of that sector. After the data streams are contained on the platform, the data needs to be converted into a pivot-table format and displayed in a tableau (dashboard) in order to perform data analysis. From the analysis one has to be able to make some business decisions based on the results from the tableau. Design Science will be applied to this study, which means errors will be documented as well as the progress made in order to provide a meaningful perspective of the knowledge gained by designing and building the artefact. The overall objective of this study is to design and develop an artefact that implements a streamed database/platform via sensory input, to provide meaningful information from the data received. 

It is rather apparent that a different approach will have to be followed and different literature studies might have to be examined to design and implement an IoT data streaming and tableau analysis-based application in order to build a knowledge base on how to successfully receive sensory input from an Arduino R3 Uno and read the input as a stream to the Kafka streaming platform. 

Problem statement

This study is done to contribute to a knowledge base on how to design and implement an IoT system. As mentioned in the background of the study, few IoT systems gets deployed real-time. The aim of this study is not only to contribute to knowledge on how to design and implement an IoT system, but also to enable a smoother deployment of future IoT systems. The study should contribute to the effort of enabling more IoT systems to get deployed in the future, smart and automated systems should eventually become a daily occurrence in the future generation’s everyday lives, such as breathing or walking. This study aims to find a different perspective on how to implement and design an IoT system, contributing to gaps currently in this research area. This research should enable junior developers and individuals with little to no experience in the IoT or software development field to quickly setup and run an IoT system, all the way from connecting sensors to an Arduino Uno R3, streaming the sensory input data to a streaming platform/database, converting the data into a pivot-table format and sending the formatted data to a dashboard to perform analytics. Based on the results, one should be able to make an informed business decision from the data visuals on the dashboard. An important aspect of this study is to resolve the gap in IoT research (for instance, related to the healthcare industry), and to present a working artefact (IoT system) that contributes to solving a real-life problem or automating a task humans find laborious. The study should aim to provide very simplistic documentation as well as tools and architecture to design and implement an IoT system. As such anyone should be able to build and deploy their very own IoT system with just a few instructions and guidelines. The study should provide documentation on how to resolve errors within an IoT system or how to find a different approach to resolve an obstacle when trying to design and implement an IoT system. To solve the research question at the end of the day: there should be enough literature and guidelines to design and implement an IoT system that receives sensory input from an Arduino, stream the input data to a streaming platform, formatted data from the streaming platform should be uploaded to a dashboard, and the dashboard results via data visualisation techniques should be able to assist the user in making an informed business decision, relevant to the use case it was designed for. The reader should be able to design and implement their own IoT system by following the guidelines/instructions from this literature study.

Paradigmatic perspective

Critical Realism (CR)

The paradigms of positivism and interpretivism are being challenged by critical realism (CR), which is a rival paradigm to the aforementioned (Wynn & Williams, 2008:2). CR-based research methodologies can be particularly useful for conducting research to examine complex organizational occurrences in a comprehensive way in order to establish deep contextual and causal explanations that account for the wide range of environmental and organizational elements that contribute to their occurrence (Wynn & Williams, 2008:2). CR-based research responds to current calls for systems-oriented MIS theories, which can be used to discover the processes that link a series of unpredictably occurring events and complicated interactions (Wynn & Williams, 2008:2). Theorists and researchers can use Critical Realism to develop more precise explanations for a group of occurrences or events. (Wynn & Williams, 2008:2). It is not necessary to use procedures that are more appropriate for the natural sciences, thus CR can be seen as the preferred paradigm for approaching complex phenomena, such as occurrences often observed in information systems (Wynn & Williams, 2008:2). CR allows for the expansion and improvement of existing research methods. (Wynn & Williams, 2008:2). 

Regarding social scientific research, critical realism became a powerful alternative paradigm to conduct research, opposing positivism and interpretivism (Wynn & Williams, 2008:3).       Contemporary CR is ontologically based and aims to answer what reality should be like for science to become achievable (Wynn & Williams, 2008:3).  The last-mentioned is based mostly on Roy Bhaskar's ideas (Wynn & Williams, 2008:3).  The core assumption of Critical Realism is that hypotheses developed by a scientific study must centre around the objective fact that makes up the world, even when humans are sometimes unable to completely comprehend or experience this reality, and our existing knowledge regarding objective reality is far from perfect (Wynn & Williams, 2008:3).  Consequently, CR has been dubbed as "ontologically bold but epistemologically cautious” by W. Outhwaite (Wynn & Williams, 2008:3).  Hence, CR research focuses on determining what reality should be so as to explain the happening of a specific set of events (Wynn & Williams, 2008:3). 

Critical realism claims that the world is not falsifiable to the conditions through which humans get access to it (Wynn & Williams, 2008:4). To rephrase: humans only see a small part of the objective world, and nature of the objective world is difficult to grasp, characterize, and measure (Wynn & Williams, 2008:4). The ideas that emerge through scientific practice are part of a transitive dimension of science that includes knowledge generated by humans with the aim of explaining and understanding the objective nature of the universe, which is an intransitive dimension in and of itself (Wynn & Williams, 2008:4). These theories can't be directly compared to the real world; instead, humans can only perform comparisons to see how well the explanation of the observable occurrences under investigation happens to be (Wynn & Williams, 2008:4). The contrast between experiences, events, and structures distinguishes Critical Realism from empiricist theories like positivism (Wynn & Williams, 2008:5). Critical Realism understands that phenomena occurring within an environment can be quantified, such as experiences, and they are likely to only make up a small portion of the actual events that occur inside a given social system (Wynn & Williams, 2008:6). As a result, ontologically, events that occur within a given structure are unrelated to the experiences that we can objectively observe and measure (Wynn & Williams, 2008:6). Critical Realism sees reality as an open system that humans cannot directly influence  (Wynn & Williams, 2008:6).

Critical realism aims to explain objective reality through participants' observations and interpretations, as well as the examination of additional objective data (Wynn & Williams, 2008:7). As a result, knowledge claims generated by Critical Realism researchers are centred on identifying components of reality, specifically mechanisms and structures, that must exist in order for the events/experiences that are being investigated to take place (Wynn & Williams, 2008:7). These knowledge claims are predicated on a number of CR-specific epistemological assumptions: explanation rather than prediction or comprehension, socially mediated knowledge and explanation by mechanisms, being unable to observe mechanisms, as well as various plausible mechanisms (Wynn & Williams, 2008:7). The belief in the presence of a mechanism that is warranted is typically hampered with in Critical Realism by the reality that these processes are rarely observable or measurable (Wynn & Williams, 2008:8). The impacts manifested in the subsequent events and experiences are sometimes the only way to identify these processes and the structural components from which they are created  (Wynn & Williams, 2008:8). Actual occurrences our experiences of them, as well as the underlying mechanisms and structures that interact to create them, are separate, which is consistent with stratified ontology principles. (Wynn & Williams, 2008:8). Consequently, the observant’s knowledge assertions may be based on both observable and unobservable elements, such as structures and mechanisms (Wynn & Williams, 2008:8). 

Following the discussion of the essence of Critical realism, the following figure illustrates this paradigm’s methodologies/approaches:



Figure 1: Key Relationships between Ontological, Epistemological and Methodological Principles (Wynn & Williams, 2008:9)

The table below gives a summary of the methodologies typically implemented in a CR study:

The figure below indicates research objects along with their research modes and purpose in a Critical Realism study:



Figure 2: A taxonomy of information systems research approaches (Dobson, 2001:203)



One can speculate from the discussion of the essence of Critical Realism, as well as the figures above, Critical Realism would be the suited paradigm for this study. CR is perfect for researching IS areas where complex events occur within an open system, and only explanations and descriptions are necessary to provide for the current events occurring. Understanding how and why these events occur is insignificant within a Critical Realism paradigm. CR is also perfect for contributing to current knowledge and expanding on a subject. There is a clear distinction between experiences, events, and structures within a CR paradigm, and those elements should be objectively examined while considering that there are factors that those elements cannot influence. Critical Realism is suited for this study, since a researcher can observe and interpret events occurring within a system, while keeping objectivity in mind and considering that the truth/reality are relative. The main aim of CR is to explain why certain events in a system occur, rather than a prediction or comprehension of why these events occur in a system. Critical Realism also takes into consideration that there are events within a system that can be unobservable. Experiences and observations are an important aspect of Critical Realism, as a result, it's critical to keep track of your experiences/observations in order to get a more objective/partial picture of reality. Another important part regarding the paradigm is the methodologies that will be followed to gain knowledge and research a subject area. An empirical approach will be followed to gain knowledge and conduct the literature study via experiments and testing. By examining Figure 1, the applicable ontology will most likely be an Objective Reality or Open Systems Perspective. The applicable epistemology will likely be Explanations rather than Prediction or Explanations via Mechanisms. The most suited methodology for this study will be an empirical corroboration approach. When examining Figure 2, one can speculate that the appropriate modes to investigate in this literature study will be laboratory experiments, field experiments and possibly surveys. Due to the nature of the study, using surveys to collect data might not be the best possible approach, due to the fact that the research is based on designing and implementing an IoT system. Surveys provide more quantitative approach to sample data based on a hypothesis or answering a theoretical research question. To conclude:  Critical Realism is the most effective research paradigm to use to carry out the literature study, since one of the main objectives of the study is to build a knowledge base on how to design and implement an IoT system. Experiences should be documented thoroughly and events occurring should be analysed without understanding the deeper cause of all events occurring in the research environment.

Study design

The study design revolves around Design Science Research (DSR), as well as experimentations and documenting experiences. When designing objectives using this methodology, the available knowledge base is usually insufficient, and designers must rely on intuition, experiences, as well as trial-and-error methods (Hevner et al., 2004:99). The artefact produced by the study is an experiment, and usually one makes use of new and upcoming technological methods/tools to design and build the artefact and finally being able to answer a research question (Hevner et al., 2004:99). Using DSR, researchers can explore the nature of the problem, the environment(s) it occurs in, and formulate solutions as a result of the artefact’s execution, which emphasizes the need of creating and implementing prototype artefacts (Hevner et al., 2004:99). Within the Information Systems context, it so happens that the design-science research paradigm is technologically proactive (Hevner et al., 2004:98). It focuses on developing and analysing cutting-edge IT artefacts that help organisations tackle critical information driven activities (Hevner et al., 2004:98). The behavioural science research paradigm is reactive to technology (Hevner et al., 2004:98). It focuses on the development and justification of theories that tries to explain and predict strange occurrences connected to the possession, deployment, management, and application of such technologies (Hevner et al., 2004:98). Problems within Design Science Research includes an exaggeration of technology artefacts and failing to maintain a sufficient conceptual framework, which could result in a artefacts that is well designed,  but happens to be ineffective in real-world organizational settings (Hevner et al., 2004:98). This study aims to provide an artefact that provides value to society and can be deployed real-time, therefore eliminating abovementioned problems while contributing to a knowledge base on how to design and implement an effective IoT system. The figure below describes the framework to conduct DSR for a given subject area:



Figure 3: Information Systems Research Framework (Hevner et al., 2004:80)

One can conclude from this figure that experiments, field studies and simulations will have to be conducted in order to design and implement a real-time IoT system. The research methodology should be able to provide important information and resources to the knowledge base's foundations, such as theories, frameworks, constructs and methods. The figure below describes evaluation methods in order to conduct research (and most of them will be implemented in this study):



Figure 4: Design Evaluation Methods (Hevner et al., 2004:86)

To conclude: the study will be more empirical by nature and will contribute to a knowledge base on how to design and implement an IoT system, while documenting the experiences in designing and implementing the solution as well as to document obstacles or errors that occurred during the design/implementation of the artefact. The documentation on the obstacles/errors should be able to guide the user to quickly setup their own IoT system, and when the user does have a problem to implement the system according to guidelines, they should be able to get an alternative perspective on solving a problem based on the documentation. 

Research methodology

Design Science Research (DSR) 

According to Peffers et al. (2007), Design Science is a methodology or paradigm which can be used to develop and assess IT artefacts, the artefacts themselves aimed at resolving identified organizational issues. DSR entails a thorough process of designing artefacts to solve observable problems, as well as contributing to research, evaluating the planned designs, and communicating the results from observance and experiences to relevant audiences (Peffers et al., 2007:49). Typical artefacts produced using the DSR methodology includes instantiations, methods, models and constructs, to name a few (Peffers et al., 2007:49). Social innovations or unique properties of technological, social, or informational resources may also be included. (Peffers et al., 2007:49). To sum up: any product created with an incorporated solution in mind to an extensively researched topic is included in this description (Peffers et al., 2007:49). The methodology that will be used to conduct this study is Design Science Research that falls under the Critical Realism paradigm. Before diving into the lifecycle of the project using DSR, q quick recap is needed on what the study is about. The goal of this research is to learn how to read sensory input as a stream from an Arduino R3 Uno and transfer it to a streaming platform (as mentioned in the Introduction, the Kafka streaming platform is preferable). After the data has been stored on the platform, it must be converted into a pivot-table format and shown on a dashboard (ideally Desktop Tableau). From the result based on the analysis, one should be able to make specific business decisions based on the tableau's conclusions. The research focuses on the design and implementation of an artefact that can collect sensory input, store data as streams, and display the findings in a tableau so that analytics may be performed. Another important aspect of this study is to contribute to a knowledge base on how to design and implement an effective IoT system that can be deployed real-time. Experiences and observations should be documented, and they should serve as guidelines on how to successfully design and setup an IoT system, while also providing insights on how to tackle problems by looking at a different angle. The following diagram illustrates the lifecycle of a project using Design Science Research (the steps that will be used to design and implement this project): 



Figure 5: Design Science Research Methodology Process Model (Peffers et al., 2007:54)

A further elaboration on each step in the above process model will follow:

Identifying the problem and motivation

Define the research question in detail and justify the importance of a solution (Peffers et al., 2007:54). The research question will be used to create an artefact that can provide a functional solution, breaking down the problem piece by piece can allow the solution to capture the complexity of the problem, and proves to be beneficial in the long run (Peffers et al., 2007:54). Being able to motivate why a solution can be used to solve a problem contributes to both the researcher and intended audience to pursue the answer and to accept results flowing out of the solution, while also visualising the researcher’s reasoning regarding how to solve the research question (Peffers et al., 2007:55). Emphasis is placed on understanding the problem and how to resolve it (Peffers et al., 2007:55).

Defining the objectives of a solution

From the problem definition and knowledge of what is achievable, deduce the goals of a solution (Peffers et al., 2007:55). Objectives might be quantitative, such as the terms in which a desirable solution would be preferable to current ones, or qualitative, such as a description of how a new artefact is meant to provide answers to previously unsolved problems (Peffers et al., 2007:55). The objectives should be logically deduced from the problem description (Peffers et al., 2007:55). Observance of the current state of problems, as well as existing solutions (if they exist) and their effectiveness, are essential to define the objectives of a solution (Peffers et al., 2007:55). 

Design and development of the artefact

During this step the researcher starts to build the artefact (Peffers et al., 2007:55). Artefacts include constructs, models, procedures, or instantiations (all of them defined rather broadly), and they novel qualities of social, technological, or any other informational resources (Peffers et al., 2007:55). Any constructed object that incorporates a research input into the design is referred to as a design research artefact (Peffers et al., 2007:55). This activity entails identifying the desired functionality or purpose and the architecture of the artefact (Peffers et al., 2007:55). Finally, the researcher has to build the artefact (Peffers et al., 2007:55). One of the resources required for changing from aims to design and development is knowledge of theory that may be used to design and implement a solution (Peffers et al., 2007:55).

Demonstration of the artefact

The researcher has to demonstrate that an artefact works or contributes to solving a problem (Peffers et al., 2007:55). The researcher might have to simulate several instances of a problem to verify that the artefact actually does its job (Peffers et al., 2007:55). Methods to test whether an artefact’s functionality follows user requirements could be done via experimenting with it, running simulations, performing case studies, documenting experiences and observations, or any other activity that is relevant (Peffers et al., 2007:55). Effective understanding of how to use the artefact to address the problem is one of the most important principles required for the demonstration (Peffers et al., 2007:55). 

Evaluation of the artefact

Examine and assess how efficient the artefact supports a solution that contributes to solving a problem (Peffers et al., 2007:56). This exercise entails comparing a solution's objectives to actual results observed from the demonstrations of the artefact (Peffers et al., 2007:56). It necessitates an understanding of key measurements and analysis methods (Peffers et al., 2007:56). Depending on the nature of the problem and the type of artefact, evaluation can take on many various forms. (Peffers et al., 2007:56). It may include a comparison between the functioning of the artefact or the goals of the solution from step 2 in the process model, objective quantitative performance measurements like budgets or items produced, survey results based on customer/participant satisfaction, client feedback, or simulations, among others (Peffers et al., 2007:56). It could include measurable system performance indicators like response times or availability (Peffers et al., 2007:56). In theory, such an assessment may incorporate any relevant logical proof or empirical evidence (Peffers et al., 2007:56).

Communicating the results to peers or intended audience

If necessary, one should make researchers and other target audiences, such as practicing professionals, aware about the problem and its significance, the artefact itself, its value and distinctiveness, the thoroughness of its design, and its effectiveness (Peffers et al., 2007:56). The formal structure of an empirical research process (identifying and describing a problem, literature review, the development of a hypothesis, data sampling, analysis, observations and results, debates or discussions, and finally the conclusion) is also a required framework for empirical research papers, and researchers may use the framework of this process to structure the paper in scholarly research publications (Peffers et al., 2007:56). Communication necessitates familiarity with the presumptions, point of views, approaches, methodological analysis, and core beliefs members of an academic disciplinary community have (Peffers et al., 2007:56).

Limitations

According to Watt (2014:14), limitations and constraints of projects typically include the following:

Cost

A budget that has been approved, which covers all the necessary completion costs (Watt, 2014:14). Because many initiatives receive money or subsidies with rigorous contract terms,, project managers must strike a balance between not running out of funds and not underspending inside companies (Watt, 2014:14). Budget preparations that aren't well-executed can lead to a number 99 scramble to spend the funds available (Watt, 2014:14). Cost is ultimately a limiting constraint for almost all projects: few projects can go beyond budget without requiring a remedial step (Watt, 2014:14).

Scope

What functionality the project should provide and the end goal of the project (Watt, 2014:14). Project outcomes are explicitly defined as well as the processes that go into creating them (Watt, 2014:14). It is the project's raison d'être and goal (Watt, 2014:14). Scope limitations can cause a project to fail, and scope creeping cause extra strain on the project’s time frame.

Quality 

Combination of the performance criteria and stipulated standards that must be met by the project's products in order to provide the intended functionality (Watt, 2014:14). The product must deliver on its promises, solve a known problem, and give the expected benefit and value. (Watt, 2014:14). Other performance standards must be met, including maintainability, dependability and availability as well as a good conclusive result (Watt, 2014:14). The practice of evaluating overall project performance on a regular basis to verify that the project satisfies the essential quality requirements is known as quality assurance (QA). (Watt, 2014:14).

Risk

External events, in most cases, will have a negative impact on your project (Watt, 2014:14). Risk is defined as how likely an event will occur as well as the foreseen impact on the project if the risk does occur (Watt, 2014:14). If a risk happens to be a foreseen possibility, and the consequences of the risk are  extremely disastrous , one should classify the event as a risk and implement a proactive risk management plan (Watt, 2014:14).

Resources

Any assets that are needed to complete the project's tasks (Watt, 2014:14). Usually resources consist of funds, facilities, equipment, people or any other type of asset (usually labour is not included) that is necessary to view a project activity as being successfully completed (Watt, 2014:14). One can speculate how a project can be negatively affected if inadequate resources are assigned to a project.

Time

The time frame needed to complete a project (Watt, 2014:14). One of the most common project oversights is time (Watt, 2014:14). Missed deadlines and incomplete deliverables are evidence of this (Watt, 2014:14). The proper control of the schedule necessitates the precise identification of tasks to be completed, as well as accurate estimates of their durations, sequence, and allocation of personnel and other resources (Watt, 2014:14). Vacations and holidays should be considered while planning a project to include slack times (Watt, 2014:14).

Risk Analysis

According to (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:63), there are six classes used to identify risks that can occur within project management when using a DSR methodology, and each of the classes contains a number of risks that should be considered:

Business Needs

This class includes the identification, selection, and development understanding the business needs which includes problems and requirements, This also involves problem analysis and assessing alternatives (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:63). The following potential risks have been identified as a result of this activity's analysis:

Problems that have no meaning to the stakeholder (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:64).

Struggling to grasp the problem and the context it occurs within (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:64).

Incompatible stakeholder interests (some of which may or may not come to light) (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:64).

Poor understanding of the research problem (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:64).

Solving a problem that is not part of the main scope. A problem that isn't a significant contributor to the unfavourable outcomes that motivate the solution (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:64).

Poor definition of the problem that needs to be resolved (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:64).

Inappropriate formulation of the problem (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:64).

Grounding

Searching, recognizing, and understanding relevant information (recovered from the body of human knowledge that has been recorded) (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:63). The following potential risks have been identified as a result of this activity's analysis:

Incomprehension and/or failing to understand relevant existing research. Failing to comprehend the situation and excessive dependence on personal experience or imagination (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:64).

Incomprehension and/or failing to understand existing design science research used to study problem-solving technology, i.e., a lack of understanding how technology works (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:64).

Incomprehension and/or failing to understand important natural and behavioural science research that forms the base theories about understanding the essence of the problem and how to solve the problem (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:65).

Building and designing artefacts

Construct design theories, including instantiations (hypothetical solutions to solve business needs or problems, theories about the solutions) (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:63). (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:63). The following potential risks have been identified as a result of this activity's analysis:

Development of an uninstantiated (conjectural) solution that cannot be easily incorporated (being able to actually implement the solution) (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:65).

Development of a hypothetical solution that cannot solve the problem, i.e., the artefact cannot be implemented in real life and has a lot of socio-technical problems (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:65).

Developing a hypothetical solution that fails to solve the problem, i.e., requires excessive resource expenditures (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:65).

Development of a hypothetical (untested) solution that is ineffective in treating the problem, i.e., the artefact isn't the genuine reason of the seen improvement during evaluation (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:65).

Development of a hypothetical solution that is too complex to be taught to/comprehended by users, e.g., too difficult or unsophisticated (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:65).

Development of a hypothetical (untested) solution that will be difficult or impossible to implement by those who will utilize it, whether for personal or political reasons (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:65).

Development of a hypothetical solution that produces new problems, causing the solution's results to be more troublesome than the initial problem, that is major side effects (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:65).

Assess design artefacts and provide evidence for design theories or expertise.

The following potential risks have been identified as a result of this activity's analysis:

Tacit requirements (which cannot be disclosed by definition) are not addressed while evaluating solution technology, resulting in the solution technology failing to meet those requirements (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:66).

While any or all of the relevant needs are not surfaced, they are not addressed when evaluating the solution technology, resulting in the technology failing to meet those specifications (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:66).

Misalignment of specifications to Information Systems Design Theory (ISDT) meta-requirements results in the IDST being tested and an embodiment of the meta-design being evaluated in a circumstance where none of them should be used (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:66).

Incorrect implementation of the meta-design or design method in designing an instantiation (not in accordance with the ISDT) results in the evaluation of anything but the correct and relevant solution technology or ISDT (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:66).

Improperly constructing a technology instantiation (in such a way that it fails to sufficiently represent the meta-design) results in the assessment of anything but the correct and relevant solution technology or ISDT (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:66).

Difficulties in implementing the solution technology during naturalistic evaluation, such as unforeseen business/organizational issues, prohibit the solution technology's embodiment from fulfilling its objectives (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:66).

Success of the solution technology to meet its objectives is not obtained due to dynamic or changing requirements beyond the scope of the solution technology (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:66).

Due to weak change management techniques, the solution technology fails to reach its objectives (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:66).

Determination of success or failure in reaching the objectives of the solution technology is error-prone or impossible due to disagreement about objectives or inability to measure (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:66).

Existing organizational culture, local organizational culture differences (sub-cultures), political conflicts, etc. complicate the evaluation process or weaken the ability to make meaningful measurement of the achievement of the objectives of the solution technology (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:66).

Artefact dissemination and use

Disseminate new artefacts, design theories, and knowledge to individuals and organizations for practical applications in order to meet business needs (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:64). The following potential risks have been identified as a result of this activity's analysis:

A solution's implementation in practice does not work at all (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:67).

Misunderstanding the solution's suitable context and constraints (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:67).

Misunderstanding how to implement the solution (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:67).

Adoption, dissemination, and organizational implementation are all handled incorrectly (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:67).

Knowledge additions

Publish new design artefacts and theories, and design knowledge that has practicality in order to tackle or improve business needs and problems (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:64). The following potential risks have been identified as a result of this activity's analysis:

Impossibility of publishing or presenting research findings (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:67).

Low-importance research is published (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:67).

Publication of erroneous study findings (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:67).

Design artefacts are far too distinctive to be widely disseminated (Pries-Heje et al., 2014:67).

Executive Summary

The purpose of this study is to figure out how to read sensory information from an Arduino R3 Uno as a stream and send it to a streaming platform (as mentioned in the Introduction, the Kafka streaming platform is preferable). The data must be translated into a pivot-table format and displayed on a dashboard after it has been stored on the platform (ideally Desktop Tableau). Based on the tableau's conclusions, one should be able to make specific business decisions based on the analysis' results. The study focuses on the development and implementation of an artefact that can receive sensory input, store data as streams, and show the results in a tableau for analytics. Another important aspect of this study is that it should contribute to a body of knowledge on how to develop and implement a real-time IoT system. Experiences and observations should be documented and used as recommendations for designing and implementing an IoT system, as well as providing insights into how to approach difficulties from a different perspective. This study falls under the Critical Realism paradigm, and the study will also focus on the events occurring within the IoT system (artefact). Documenting events, experiences and observations is an important part of this study. This study is objective by nature, even though there are events and causes which cannot easily be explained by humans. The methodology that will be implemented to conduct this study is Design Science Research, which is empirical by nature. Field studies, experiments and simulations will have to be conducted in order to design and implement a real-time IoT system.
