Introduction
A brief description of what the project is about and what it involves. Explain the aim of this chapter and mention the sections that will follow.


Background

Typically, the background of a study includes a review of the existing literature on the area of your research, leading up to your topic. Once you have discussed the contribution of other researchers in the field, you can identify gaps in understanding, that is, areas that have not been addressed in these studies. You can then explain how your study will address these gaps and how it will contribute to the existing knowledge in the field. Overview of related literature with key references.


Problem description and background
Description of research problem and its rationale. Justification for the proposed study.  
A clear research question, and the extent to which this study will help to answer the research question or what the contribution will be to the field of research (expected outcomes).


Paradigmatic perspective
Mention the research paradigm and methods that will be used – provide justification.


Aims and objectives of project
Aims:  write down general statements regarding what you would like to achieve with this project.
Objectives:  itemise the specific tasks that you will execute to achieve the aims.


Research methodology  
Mention the data collection mechanism and processing that will be done (if applicable).
Mention the artefact that must be produced and the life cycle that will be followed (if applicable).
Explain how this project is integrated with group members’ projects (if applicable).
If this is a continuation of a previous project, an indication must be given of how it will be improved and expanded.


Rigour / validity and reliability
How do you intent to show that the appropriate process has been used, the findings come from the data and answer the research question.


Ethical and legal implications and dealing with these
What is the ethical implications of your research and how will you address this?


Approach to project management and project plan 
Include a comprehensive project plan – provide graphical representation (e.g. Gantt chart).
State clearly the scope, limitations – also present risk analysis.
Refer to responsibility and contribution of each group member.

Comments

Leave open lines to organise your thoughts in introduction. Never submit a document with comments in as final assignment. Your risk assessment is too long. Refine your methodology to include the tools etc. which you are using – try not to give too much info not required. Your references are not quite enough. I the URL is so long, rather omit it.

Overall, very well done! 83/100
