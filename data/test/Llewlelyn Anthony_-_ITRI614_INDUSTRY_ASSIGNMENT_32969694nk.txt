ABSTRACT

Within most organisations, the desire for financial gain and competitive advantage drives technological advancement. Shorter project life spans, rapid replacements, and obsoleteness are becoming more frequent in advancements in information and Communications Technology (ICT). Most organisations struggle to efficiently and effectively manage and commit to ICT initiatives, including developing a lasting ICT environment beneficial to human and social demands. Many ICT projects have failed miserably, and CEOs are beginning to demand explanations as to why. The researcher has been named the new Chief Information Officer (CIO) of company XYZ and has been tasked to discuss which relevant project management approaches the individual thinks will be the most beneficial in the next three to five years. The researcher needs to debate why organisations, portfolio, program, and project managers should take notice of current relevant project management methodologies in addition to how the Management of company XYZ should strategize and conduct planning, catering, and manage projects to maximize potential benefits and eliminate all risks related with the chosen project management approaches, while also considering the requirements of internal and external clients and the forces they represent. The focus should not only fall on existing and future project management methodologies like projects in controlled environments, such as Six Sigma, Rational Unified Process (RUP), Agile, PRINCE2, and so on, but also on bodies of knowledge like PMBOK and governance frameworks like COBIT and ITIL. The general idea is to overcome the constraints typically associated with projects, namely time, scope and budget.

Chapter 1: INTRODUCTION

A Quick Overview

The main aim of this report is to address constraints typically associated with projects in the industry and find the most applicable project management methodologies, bodies of knowledge, and governance frameworks to follow to mitigate risks and maximize opportunities for projects. Extensive research on project management trends, project management methodologies and their capabilities, bodies of knowledge (project management standards), and governance frameworks exist. According to Paredes and Ribeiro (2018:641), sustainability and management of projects and the value and benefit of projects are becoming increasingly important factors when managing projects. Projects are becoming increasingly complex and thus more suspectable to changes within the project's scope (Paredes & Ribeiro, 2018:642). Growth and diversification of stakeholders, extended project scopes, higher diversities of cultures within organisations, virtualization of projects, and the increasing amount of information have a lasting impact on current projects (Paredes & Ribeiro, 2018:642). Change management has become more important to address changes within projects and communicate the changes to stakeholders (Paredes & Ribeiro, 2018:642). Agile and hybrid methods of managing projects and their lifecycle is a key trend within the current industry. Agile methods are more suited for the current industry because it supports change management, teams can consist of fewer members, increased delivery times, changes to source code are less expensive and rapid development is beneficiary (Paredes & Ribeiro, 2018:642).

SCRUM, Kanban and XP are but a few of the examples. Benefits management is essential, because benefits are connected to changes a project undergoes and delivers (Paredes & Ribeiro, 2018:643). Benefit management aims to allow a project to meet the specified stakeholder requirements while also increasing the benefits a project provides (Paredes & Ribeiro, 2018:643). A paradigm shift has also occurred in the sustainable project management stages of planning, monitoring, implementing, and assessment to ensure accuracy and relevancy. (El Khatib et al., 2020:1278). Artificial intelligence and other modern technologies have been implemented to mitigate project risks and successfully manage projects (El Khatib et al., 2020:1278).  In the modern era, the range of skills required by a project manager determines a project's viability. (El Khatib et al., 2020:1278). Projects in the future should be able to support multilingual and multicultural capabilities (Jugdev et al., 2009:234), be more remotely based (Jugdev et al., 2009:234), specialized project managers will be needed in accordance to political and legal factors (Jugdev et al., 2009:235), sustainable and green projects that contributes to ecological preservation (Jugdev et al., 2009:235), a demand in project managers that knows how to implement new technologies that supports project management will increase (Jugdev et al., 2009:236). 

Numerous projects fail because they do not meet the abovementioned requirements. According to Whittaker (1999:23), KPMG's 1997 Survey of Unsuccessful Information Technology Projects discovered that the three most prevalent causes of project failure are poor project planning, flawed business cases, and a lack of involvement and support from senior management. Among other failures, the survey highlighted that projects were more prone to failure due to schedule than budget overruns (Whittaker, 1999:23). Many projects also fail because of implementing new/unproven technology, primarily when they are poorly comprehended by developers (Whittaker, 1999:23). Failing to stipulate project requirements and not understanding them is also a major contributor to project failures (Whittaker, 1999:23). It is also important to note that nearly 60% of unsuccessful projects were scheduled to be completed within a year (Whittaker, 1999:23). Other sources, like Attarzadeh and Ow (2008:236), state that other significant causes of project failures are cost and schedule estimations and planning that went awry, project scope changes (scope creeping) and the incorrect use of project management methodologies (Attarzadeh & Ow, 2008:236). There is also a human factor involved, i.e. project managers with inadequate skills who are not trained to manage projects properly (Attarzadeh & Ow, 2008:236). Lack of communication between stakeholders and the project team is also a significant issue. Nelson (2007) mentions that employee morale plays a critical role in a project’s success and that motivation, skills and team member relationships play a key role and can lead to disastrous results if one of the aforementioned is not present in project team dynamics. The human inclination to underestimate and overestimate timetables, among other issues, makes the failure of a project more eminent by not properly defining the scope of a project, which harms project planning (Nelson, 2007). Requirements shortcomings and/or quality assurance also negatively impact projects (Nelson, 2007).  Poor estimating also places undue strain on team members, resulting in lower morale and productivity (Nelson, 2007). Failure to assess risks properly and implementing a contingency plan results in project failures (Nelson, 2007).

From the sources above, one can speculate why projects can fail so quickly and why it can be challenging to effectively manage projects, aim for successful completion, and provide the promised project benefits. 



This study aims to study how related project management approaches and success are. The Abstract section provided a quick overview of the research problem, and the Introduction provided a quick overview of the study with background information. The Related Works section will cover relevant literature on the research topic. The System Model discusses hypotheses about the research topic, and the hypotheses will be based on the Introduction and Relevant Works content. The Problem Statement will give a brief overview of the research problem. Project Management Methodologies, Bodies of Knowledge and Governance Frameworks will respectively have sections, the essence of each, and the pros and cons, will be discussed in those sections. The Solution section provides an overview of the functionality of the proposed solution: what PM methodologies/frameworks/bodies of knowledge are best suited to manage current projects. The Analysis section will provide statistics on the project management methodologies, comparing them and pointing out their success rates. Finally, a conclusion will be derived from the content in this report, indicating the most applicable project management methodology that will contribute to project success.







Chapter 2: RELATED WORKS

A General Overview



As mentioned in the Introduction, extensive research exists on the research question. This section covers a few existing literature samples on the research question. Does there exist a relationship between project management methodologies being implemented by project managers and the success rate of projects? According to Pace (2019:62), there is not always a link between the use of a project management approach and the success rate of a project. Maintaining a consistent project success rate (Pace, 2019:62). Projects can often fail due to scope variance, failing to understand the problem and uncertainty, complexity, and vaguely defined requirements (Pace, 2019:62). It is challenging to set a performance criteria standard as projects differ in scope and requirements (Pace, 2019:62). One project methodology implemented in one project successfully might not be suited at all for another project (Pace, 2019:62). Thus, it remains a challenge to gain consistent project success (Pace, 2019:62). Project Management Methodologies are only as good as the clarity of objectives and procedures of projects (Pace, 2019:62). Most of these approaches are chosen and implemented at the beginning of a project and are not modified as the project develops to meet new scope needs (Pace, 2019:62). Shifting from a Six-Sigma methodology to a Critical Chain methodology, for example, is a highly challenging transition (Pace, 2019:62). Static implementation of methodologies is effective when there is little ambiguity or complexity within a project, but it is useless in today's environment in terms of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (Pace, 2019:62). 



As trends changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, systems became more digitized, and more people started to work and communicate remotely. The pandemic also impacted how to manage projects effectively and efficiently. The pandemic caused business owners and project managers to question how they can sell their services/goods through an online channel, how they can offer products/services that are in demand with their existing infrastructure, and how to increase the rate at which products/services are produced or distributed (Savio, 2021:9). Savio (2021) states that the pandemic brought forth the following changes in project management: expansion of AI and Automation (Savio, 2021:9), more frequent implementation of Agile approaches in projects (Savio, 2021:9), increased remoteness of jobs (Savio, 2021:10), Emotional Intelligence (EQ) using project managers being able to manage their employees and raise their morale/productivity (Savio, 2021:11). Finally, IoT and smart systems also started to play a more significant role in managing projects (Savio, 2021:11). Project managers can employ automation to accomplish complex activities such as scheduling and data visualization, and then make informed decisions based on the gathered insights (Savio, 2021:9). By employing Agile methodologies, organisations can manage changing priorities more effectively, enjoy better project visibility and produce faster delivery times for projects (Savio, 2021:10). Agile methodologies also make use of an iterative process, which is much more adaptable to current projects, ensuring constant communication with stakeholders and iterative improvements occur within a project (Savio, 2021:9). Virtual meetings and video conferences are becoming ever more present as jobs tend to get more remotely, file sharing and synchronization becomes more essential to share resources remotely, project status tracking and reporting also becomes more important to help project members complete task and activities on time from any location in the world (Savio, 2021:10). Cybersecurity attacks and risks are also increasing as more jobs become remotely, which means businesses should train their employees and make them aware of possible cyber-attacks and threats (Savio, 2021:10). Implementing IoT systems to assist project managers in planning/scheduling/managing projects has some perks (Savio, 2021:11). It helps with real-time productivity, the optimization and automation of business processes, and real-time monitoring and tracking of projects (Savio, 2021:11).

The comprehension of when to implement a specific project management methodology is a precious skill in the project management field. Even though there is currently no ideal solution that aids in project management and success, company executives and project managers are shifting to agile project management as a major solution to help them overcome this strain (Salameh, 2014:71). The growing necessity to provide high-quality products in a dynamic and rapidly changing global market compelled professionals to develop APM methodologies. (Salameh, 2014:71). Scholars have noted traditional project approaches for their long term use as a source of formality in project management and their success in guiding and managing projects (Salameh, 2014:71). Since project requirements can be intangible and volatile, traditional project management approaches are typically not well suited for complex projects, such as  IT and software projects (Salameh, 2014:71). APM has arisen as a very iterative and incremental approach in which the project team and stakeholders work together to comprehend the domain, define project requirements, and prioritize feature requirements (Salameh, 2014:71). Agile methodologies are more suitable for current projects due to their ability to be adaptable to smaller scopes, and they provide rapid delivery times (Salameh, 2014:71). APM yields increased productivity and quality, mainly due to iterative communication with stakeholders, eliminating scope creeping and requirements misunderstandings (Salameh, 2014:71). It is worth noting that projects using Agile approaches were five times more effective than those using traditional methodologies. (Salameh, 2014:71). Projects that implemented Agile methodologies also had eleven times greater ROIs (Salameh, 2014:71). APM has proven to be a valuable approach for managing high-risk, time-sensitive research-and-development projects due to its lightweight processes that lead to effective decision making and productivity (Salameh, 2014:71). Regular client interaction and early concept testing lead to speedy and market-sensitive outputs (Salameh, 2014:71). These outcomes, in order, promote customer satisfaction, which improves the customer’s trust in the business, companies’ client retention remains at a higher level, and customer loyalty is ensured, which leads to several satisfactory results for businesses such as increased sales, revenues, and overall profitability (Salameh, 2014:71). Regarding governance frameworks: COBIT 2019 is an enterprise-wide framework for the governance and management of information and technology (Audit & Association, 2018:9).  Enterprise I&T refers to all of the technology and information processing that an enterprise uses to achieve its goals, regardless of where it occurs inside the enterprise (Audit & Association, 2018:9). Thus, corporate I&T is does not only include an organization's IT department (Audit & Association, 2018:9). The COBIT (Control Objectives for Information Technologies) framework ensures that mutually agreed-upon corporate goals is established via the assessment of stakeholder requirements, prioritization and decision making determine the course of action managers take, and that performance and compliance are assessed against agreed-upon goals/objectives (Audit & Association, 2018:9). COBIT guarantees that an organization has a governance system in place via explicitly defined components, design factors are considered to build the most efficient governance system and incorporates critical governance mechanisms into governance/management goals that can be managed to the required competence levels (Audit & Association, 2018:9). According to Magalhaes (2019), some of the benefits provided by the COBIT 2019 framework includes improved orientations with global standards, frameworks as well as best practices. The framework provides frequent updates and improvements, continuous feedback/advancements, and provides flexible guidance on how to efficiently/effectively govern IT projects (Magalhaes, 2019). The framework provides clarity on the features that enterprises require for a solid governance structure (Magalhaes, 2019). COBIT 2019 also integrates well with other governance standards/frameworks such as ITIL, ISO/IEC 2000, and CMMI (Magalhaes, 2019). The maturity of other standards and practices are guaranteed by implementing a governance framework like COBIT 2019 (Magalhaes, 2019). A key benefit is that the framework complies to government standards (Magalhaes, 2019). The framework aids in the alignment current frameworks with overarching strategy and performance monitoring (Magalhaes, 2019). Finally, in order to fulfil objectives, it aligns IT with enterprise goals, which produce value to businesses, and mitigate business risks (Magalhaes, 2019). By analysing the content of this section, one can deduce that by choosing the optimal governance framework, body of knowledge as well as project management methodology, one’s organisation can gain a considerable competitive advantage and lower business risk rates/possibilities.



Summary – in short out of these findings, what are your deductions, conclusions and recommendations?





Chapter 3: SYSTEM MODEL

System Model Formulation and Design

The system model will be based on hypotheses derived from the Introductory sections. The system model has three main components: governance framework, knowledge body, and project management methodology. In order to present Company XYZ with a solution as to which project management methodology to choose to manage and plan their projects, a good overview will require a governance framework, which implements a body of knowledge, and each type of project will need a respective project management methodology, which is guided by standards and principles from the body of knowledge and governance framework. Thus, all hypotheses lie on three pillars: governance framework, the body of knowledge and project management methodologies. There are three hypotheses regarding the research question: COBIT 2019 will be the best IT governance framework to implement since it is a standard governance framework used by various companies. It also provides structure and many benefits to managing projects. PMBOK will be the best fit body of knowledge to provide standards for managing and planning projects. Finally, based on the Introductory content, an Agile methodology (APM) will be the most suited approach to implement project management on a project. The figure below describes the system model: Governance frameworks will be discussed, from which the body of knowledge will flow that is implemented in the governance framework (provides project management standards), from the body of knowledge flows the project management methodology (traditional and agile methodologies will be discussed). The system model should help to answer the research question.

Chapter 4: PROBLEM STATEMENT

A Quick Overview



The Research Question can be defined as the following: what project management methodology, standard and governance framework will most be applied to managing and planning current projects within a business-IT context? The research in this report should help project managers manage changes in projects and provide guidelines to successfully reduce risks within a project and provide a competitive advantage to an organisation. The sustainability and maturity levels of a project should also be a key focus point. The selected governance framework, standard and project management methodology should mitigate project failures and possibly provide a kind of “guideline” to standardize project success. Stakeholder requirements and organisational structure should be considered while trying to solve the research problem. Internal and external factors that impacts an organisation’s capability to efficiently and effectively manage projects cannot be overlooked and contributes to the formulation of the solution. The research problem also involves the three primary project constraints: schedule, time and budget. So how can project managers successfully implement project management by looking at standards and methodologies? How can project managers mitigate risks and maximize business opportunities by implementing a selected project management strategy?

Chapter 5: SOLUTION

Structure and Functionalities

Based on the research question, the hypotheses are that current projects should be governed by implementing the COBIT 2019 governance framework. PMBOK should be used as the body of knowledge that provides standards for guiding and managing projects (and is supported by the COBIT 2019 framework, but not limited to). The most applicable project management methodology will be APM, as it is iterative and adaptable to current projects that frequently undergo scope changes with faster delivery times. The solution to the research question and attempt to prove the hypotheses will be formulated via analysing three sections:  Governance Frameworks, Bodies of Knowledge (Standards), and Project Management Methodologies. The three sections should be studied thoroughly, and their principles and guidelines will be discussed. Comparisons will be provided between each governance framework, standard and project management methodology. The benefits and drawbacks of each will be discussed and an analysis will be provided after a thorough discussion on each section. While formulating the solution, stakeholder requirements, organisational structures, external/internal risks and opportunities must be considered. The solution should be able to maximize business opportunities while minimizing business and project risks. An organisation’s management must implement the proposed solution to such a degree that it can support a business’s organisational and governing structure while also providing clear guidelines and principles for managing projects. When choosing a type of approach to implement, the type of project should also be considered. To encapsulate the solution: a governance framework should be provided that ensures a company complies with government/authority regulations and defines clear objectives and approaches to risk management. A body of knowledge (standard) should be implemented that provides precise guidelines/rules on managing and completing projects (best practice). The applicable project management methodology should be chosen to support the management of a specific type of project and guide project managers into executing, planning, and managing projects. The methodology can provide tools and techniques to complete projects.

Chapter 6: GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS

The generation of business value from IT-enabled business investments is done via business and IT professionals performing their duties with the guidance of a governance framework (Ghildyal & Chang, 2017:256). When implementing a governance framework, business/IT alignment should be followed (Ghildyal & Chang, 2017:256). The four critical domains of strategic choice are business strategy, information technology strategy, organizational infrastructure and processes, and information technology infrastructure and processes, each with its own set of fundamental characteristics (Ghildyal & Chang, 2017:256). These key domains provide the interdependence of external and internal components and the integration of business and function domains (Ghildyal & Chang, 2017:256). 

Discussion

COBIT 2019

Structure/Principles

The aim of COBIT 2019 is to monitor all initiated projects inside the organization per corporate strategy and in a synchronized approach using a standard project management approach (Audit & Association, 2018:221). Projects should be initiated, planned, controlled, and executed before concluding with a post-implementation evaluation (Audit & Association, 2018:221). Key objectives are to promote communication with and the participation of business and clients to achieve project outcomes while avoiding the risk of unforeseen delays, costs, and value depreciation (Audit & Association, 2018:221). The framework should guarantee the quality and value of project outcomes while also maximizing their contribution to the programs and investment portfolios outlined (Audit & Association, 2018:221). The framework should contribute toward enterprise and alignment goals (Audit & Association, 2018:221). Optimizing business processes and managing digital transformation programs are common enterprise goals (Audit & Association, 2018:221). Benefits that become actual from IT-established benefits and services portfolios and on-time delivery of programs, according to budget and according to specified requirements and quality standards, are common alignment goals (Audit & Association, 2018:221). Essential management practices within the COBIT 2019 framework include, in the following order: Maintaining a standard approach towards project management, starting/initiating a project, managing stakeholder engagements, developing/maintaining a project plan, managing project quality and project risk, monitoring and controlling projects, managing project resources and the closure of a project and/or activities (Audit & Association, 2018:226). Related guidance is based on the PMBOK standard (Audit & Association, 2018). To reap the benefits of the COBIT architecture, a deeper understanding of the enterprise is necessary (De Haes et al., 2020:36).

Benefits

Once priorities in governance and management objectives have been established, the organization can quickly assess its current maturity in attaining governance and management goals (De Haes et al., 2020:37). COBIT 2019 provides structures for IT alignment. The framework goes beyond the immediate demands of users and consumers to ensure that IT is coordinated with bigger business ambitions (Simmonds). While also managing the complexities of day-to-day operations, a complete and well-defined top-level perspective is required (Simmonds). COBIT provides this and a common lexicon to ensure that IT experts, teams, departments, and stakeholders are all on the same page (Simmonds). COBIT ensures that enterprises remain compliant with regulations: modern information technology must comply with data and business regulations, such as the GDPR (Simmonds). When developing and revising frameworks, COBIT considers such regulations to be critical details, ensuring that they are addressed at all IT levels (Simmonds). Customers are already confident in COBIT 2019 for risk management, based on the success of COBIT 5 in this capacity (Simmonds). The framework also optimises business processes and management activities (Simmonds). COBIT 2019 is also ideal for day-to-day IT, assisting practitioners in identifying priorities and offering the tools and best practices needed to improve where appropriate (Simmonds date?).

Consequently, practitioners can benefit from more efficient, targeted, and profitable IT operations, with well-defined roles and responsibilities across teams and departments (Simmonds). Considering the rise of COBIT’s popularity, implementing it can enhance stakeholders,’ end-users’, and clients' trust (Simmonds). The stability that COBIT offers in IT can also help a company's reputation with customers. COBIT 2019 is innovative, providing information on the most recent IT tools, best practices, and so forth (Simmonds). Nevertheless, its emphasis on framework reassessments and open-source format also prepares practitioners for future changes (Simmonds). As a result, businesses can be fully prepared to evolve as needed (Simmonds).

Drawbacks

COBIT 2019 possesses a complicated structure and processes (Zhang et al., 2013:393). The essence of COBIT simply cannot be captured in a few sentences or a paragraph (Zhang et al., 2013:393). The framework consists of lengthy principles and many tools, which can take an organisation a while to adapt to and learn (Zhang et al., 2013:393). For example, there are 34 IT processes with 222 control objectives and more than 300 controls, only for the Control Objectives alone (Zhang et al., 2013:393). According to (Zhang et al., 2013:393), the generic character COBIT is challenging for corporations to understand and apply. Although the COBIT Management Principles and Implementation Instructions emphasize that COBIT must be customized to a specific environment, they do not provide particular methods or guidelines to help organizations do so. (Zhang et al., 2013:393). There are only a few case studies available from its publishers, ITGI and ISACA, and they are brief (Zhang et al., 2013:393). In comparison to IT standards that are more mature, such as ITIL and ISO27000, the usefulness of COBIT is difficult to discern (Zhang et al., 2013:393). There are no established statistics or research to back up its claimed benefits (Zhang et al., 2013:393). While a COBIT program was clear, many executives felt that they would rather place emphasis on and implement ISO27000 and ITL, which provided higher significance values (Zhang et al., 2013:393). The control objectives are given in a less-structured manner, which is one clear source of complexity (Zhang et al., 2013:393). Despite being divided into four major areas (Strategy, Finances, Stakeholders, Processes and Learning), many of them overlap in content or have structural relationships (Zhang et al., 2013:393). The IT Governance Institute (ITGI)  and the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) have stated that the main hindrance of COBIT is that it takes a considerable level of expertise to grasp the framework before it can be implemented as an efficient/effective IT governance framework (Zhang et al., 2013:391). While they believe COBIT is a useful framework, many executives agreed that they prefer to focus on ITIL and ISO27000 (Zhang et al., 2013:391).

ITIL

Structure/Principles

ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is an eight-book series that offers consistent and comprehensive best practices for IT service management and delivery (Zhang et al., 2013:392). ITIL lays the groundwork for quality IT service management (Zhang et al., 2013:392). It provides comprehensive best practices for planning, designing, and implementing effective service management capabilities and detailed methodologies, functions, roles, and processes for businesses to base their own practices on (Zhang et al., 2013:392). ITIL's third version tries to transition from a process-based framework to a more comprehensive structure that reflects the entire life cycle of IT services (Zhang et al., 2013:392). ITIL outlines processes, procedures, tasks, and checklists that are not organization or technology-specific but can be used by an organization to strategize, provide value delivery, and helps enterprises maintain a minimal level of competency (Nakakawa et al., 2019). It enables the organization to set a baseline to plan, implement, and measure its efforts (Nakakawa et al., 2019). It is used to demonstrate compliance and to track progress (Nakakawa et al., 2019). ITIL certification is offered to individuals only (Nakakawa et al., 2019). 

Benefits

Organisations all throughout the world understand the value of the ITIL framework (Cook et al., 2021:189). The most typical reasons organizations use ITIL are to increase the efficiency of operations and the improvement of quality services and customer happiness (Cook et al., 2021:189). Additionally, ITIL methodologies are linked to lower IT expenditures (Cook et al., 2021:189). Furthermore, improved Information Technology operational management, including adherence to business rules and specifications, has a direct and favourably influences certification and compliance with domestic and international regulations (Cook et al., 2021:189). Another key benefit of adopting and executing ITIL: it can assist project managers in aligning IT operations with business objectives (Cook et al., 2021:189). Research was conducted: a Strategic Alignment literature review in, concentrating on ITIL and different Strategic Alignment Models (SAM) (Cook et al., 2021:189). The holistic impact on businesses was studied (Cook et al., 2021:189). It was discovered that ITIL implementation boosted alignment by improving communication between business and IT professionals, removing impediments and enabling knowledge sharing, and strengthening ITIL's aptitude to support business initiatives (Cook et al., 2021:189). A statistically significant association between mature ITIL adoption and elevated IT/business alignment levels was also identified. (Cook et al., 2021:189). It was also observed among the “lower-level” class within organisations that ITIL increased service quality (Cook et al., 2021:189). ITIL improved workday stability, product quality, and service predictability for the working class (Cook et al., 2021:189). In addition, ITIL implementation led to more balanced workplaces, causing employees to be more productive and leading to higher morale levels in the workplace (Cook et al., 2021:189). To provide an example to illustrate the benefits of implementing ITIL: Procter & Gamble saved $125 000 000 in IT costs, within less than 72 hours Shell Oil could upgrade their software, in theory saving 6000 days of work and $5 000 000, and Caterpillar enhanced their responsive times for reporting Web incidents from thirty to ninety percent of the time (Cook et al., 2021:189).

Drawbacks

Employees that are opposed to change, oppose constraints imposed on their processes and procedures, disagree with executive objectives, prefer ad hoc creative solutions over proven approaches, and are anxious about the complexity of the new processes will face resistance to ITIL adoption in the majority of organizations (Cook et al., 2021:190). Likewise, firms that have not historically used tight criteria will see a cultural shift (Cook et al., 2021:190). Employees who are used to managing their schedules may be irritated by the loss of independence (Cook et al., 2021:190). Such opposition could lead to the project's downfall (Cook et al., 2021:190). ITIL encourages the necessity for service quality monitoring and reporting, and it makes IT personnel feel like they are constantly being monitored (Cook et al., 2021:190).

Furthermore, the adoption of ITIL represents a significant cultural shift; personnel associated with ITIL might fear that their roles will become superseded, and this reluctance may stymie the implementation process (Cook et al., 2021:190). A further study revealed common aspects of change resistance when implementing ITIL (Cook et al., 2021:190). According to the survey, the presentation of modern technology and solutions conflicted with previously established procedures and habits (Cook et al., 2021:190). A common unfavourable attitude exemplifies the problem of resistance to change among practitioners over the inconvenience of tracking cases during periods of severe activities. (Cook et al., 2021:190). These procedures, which were expected by managers who wanted concerns resolved quickly, resulted in a complex and bureaucratic process that was equally demanding and time-consuming. (Cook et al., 2021:190). With these facts in mind, it is possible to identify resistance to change as a prevalent problem in implementing and accepting ITIL (Cook et al., 2021:190). Another problem that users confront while adopting and implementing ITIL is successfully engaging them in accepting the revised procedures (Cook et al., 2021:190). Even though ITIL improves the distribution of IT services to clients, allows IT processes to business objectives migrations, and promotes the effective management of incidents, it does not provide a straightforward way to engage folks involved in activities outside of IT. (Cook et al., 2021:190). If not all system users cooperate with an accepted system, service quality suffers, and incident handling becomes delayed (Cook et al., 2021:190). Furthermore, when people are presented with new processes for dealing with IT-related incidents, their execution can be irregular and inconsistent. (Cook et al., 2021:190). Customers were discovered to frequently circumvent the new procedures by calling acquaintances in the IT department since they had a better chance of solving the problem as soon as possible (Cook et al., 2021:190). Encouraging stakeholders to engage and become motivated about ITIL implementation proved to be troublesome for project managers (Cook et al., 2021:190). The project will fail if management is unable to gain the needed support and collaboration from the stakeholders (Cook et al., 2021:190). Technical issues that can (inevitably) occur during the implementation of ITIL must be addressed by organisations (Cook et al., 2021:190). These issues include the integration of new service delivery applications, incorporating new into existing procedures, the development of measurement tools that provides great accuracy and the training of employees to reduce errors within a system caused by users (Cook et al., 2021:190).

CMM/CMMI

Structure/Principles

CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) is an improved version of CMM that includes elements for analysing and effectively managing a business (Khoja et al., 2010:21). Companies were having difficulties implementing CMM at various levels of their company, and the models happen to lack integration (Khoja et al., 2010:21). CMMI overcomes this shortcoming by incorporating the complete organisational processes and controlling them more effectively (Khoja et al., 2010:21). CMMI, like CMM, has five maturity stages (namely Initial, Managed, Defined, Quantitatively Managed, and Optimised) which the model uses to analyse and evaluate the maturity of an organization (Khoja et al., 2010:21). Each CMMI is composed of numerous process areas (such as project management, process management, engineering and support), assessment of these process areas ensures that enterprises meet their business objectives (Khoja et al., 2010:21). This allows them to study, assess, and enhance further (Khoja et al., 2010:21). It is believed that CMMI favours large enterprises since it necessitates extensive documentation and procedures (Khoja et al., 2010:21).

Benefits

A variety of companies reported gaining benefits from implementing CMMI within their company. Accenture reported that they have built management skills by focusing early on Measurement and Analysis and "thinking levels 4 and 5" (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:11). They, like many others, emphasised treating process improvement activities as projects, the necessity of obtaining management sponsorship and providing support to initiatives during transitions (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:11). According to Accenture, hours invested in quality activities might have resulted in a 5:1 return on investments (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:11). Consider Boeing's submarine project as an example of relevant CMMI results (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:12). Over an 18-month period, the average cost to fix a fault was reduced by 33% (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:12). With an improvement in the flexibility to customise builds, the time required to deliver a release was cut in half (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:12).  There have been claims that a 60% reduction in pre-test and post-test audit preparation, conduct, and rework occurred, which resulted in audits passing with little to no significant activities (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:12). It has been observed that developers at Boeing Australia have emphasised removing faults from all their products, enhancing quality, and finding methods to improve their processes (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:12). Lockheed Martin Management & Data Systems deployed a variety of technical approaches connected to design, tools, and process initiatives during the early 2000’s, during which time they attained maturity level 5 against both the SW-CMM and CMMI models (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:14). They also worked to improve the quality of their processes for detecting, preventing, and eliminating defects. During these three years, notable performance improvements include a 30 percent software productivity increase, a 20 per cent unit software cost decrease and a 15 percent costs reduction to discover and resolve faults (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:14). Thales Air Traffic Management (ATM) has advanced to CMMI maturity level 4 from SW-CMM maturity level 3 (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:17). Training and an organizational metrics dictionaries helped to support their measurement procedures 3 (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:17). Within their process diagrams, they have found decisions that necessitate Decision Analysis and Resolution approaches 3 (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:17). Risks were tracked, monitored, and kept in a database, and proper steps were taken 3 (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:18). A rising variety of processes were started to being statistically controlled, such as requirement production and confirmation, design, and coding processes 3 (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:18). They also direct their process improvement efforts based on measurement outcomes. Program, company, and team objectives are defined and measured based on process performance 3 (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:18). Business needs and customer negotiation determined the objectives, which were achieved through improvement efforts 3 (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:18). Thales ATM highlighted early defects discoveries, enhanced risk management, and better project control is one of the key benefits of Thales' ATM process improvement endeavour 3 (Goldenson & Gibson, 2003:18).

Drawbacks

Some research conducted looked into why organizations prefer not to use CMMI. The study looked at the population of organizations that have chosen not to embrace CMMI and their reasons for doing so (Staples et al., 2007:893). The sample population consisted of 40 software-development organizations that did not use the process capability maturity model SPI or wanted a CMMI Class A appraisal and decided not to purchase CMMI Level 2 Class B or C appraisal and process improvement services within a two-month recording period and provided at least one substantive reason for their decision (Staples et al., 2007:893). The most common reasons found why organisations did not implement the CMMI model were the following: their organisation was too small to efficiently and effectively implement the model, it was very costly to implement the model, time constraints were too rigid to implement the model, other forms of SPIs were already used within a company (Staples et al., 2007:893). As one can deduct from the benefits of CMMI, this model is obviously more beneficial towards larger companies to determine their maturity levels or companies that value quality control more than structure and architecture (Staples et al., 2007:893). The number of documentation and processes that must be followed to implement CMMI can be a tedious job for smaller companies that simply do not have the required infrastructure to support CMMI processes. Within smaller companies, CMMI was often found to be infeasible, or employees displayed resistance towards the implementation of CMMI within their company (Staples et al., 2007:893). Other problems that were identified with the CMMI model are that there were no coverage of safety engineering aspects, there also happened to be no extensive documentation as how to implement processes and the complex structure of the model (Ghildyal & Chang, 2017:258).





chapter 7: bodies of knowledge (standards)

Discussion

PMBOK

Structure/Principles

In an attempt to standardize widely accepted project management knowledge and procedures, the Project Management Institute (PMI) published the PMBOK Guide for the first time in 1987 (Ilieş et al., 2010:48). In 2008, the PMBOK Guide was redrafted for the fourth time, and it is now one of the most widely used project management standards (Ilieş et al., 2010:48). The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) is a collection of project management methodologies and knowledge areas typically recognized as best practices (Ilieş et al., 2010:48). The PMBOK Guide is a universally known guideline that describes the fundamentals of project management as they apply to various projects (Ilieş et al., 2010:48). Specialized standards were developed as an addition to PMBOK to meet the needs of specific sectors. (Ilieş et al., 2010:48). The COBIT 2019 framework also provides integration with PMBOK. The first section of this Guide divides 47 processes into 10 Knowledge Areas (KA) concerning the professional field, project management field, or area of specialization, such as project scope and cost management (Xue et al., 2015:16). The ten knowledge areas are Integration, Scope, Time, Cost, Quality, Human Resource, Communication, Risk and Procurement (Ghosh et al., 2012:2). This Guide reorganizes the processes in the second section to produce a project management standard (Xue et al., 2015:16). It categorizes processes into five groups based on the five stages of project implementation: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing process groups (Xue et al., 2015:16). It describes the input, methodologies and tools, output, and data flow diagram of each of the ten KA processes (Xue et al., 2015:16). All or some of the five process groups can be used at each step of systems engineering (SE), reusing any set of the processes within any stage of systems engineering is acceptable (Xue et al., 2015:16).

Benefits

PMBOK is suitable for large-scale projects and large enterprises due to its structure and principles (Xue et al., 2015:20). PMBOK is a very detailed standard and provides a diversity of techniques and tools project managers can use to manage and control projects and assess risks and evaluate company/project benefits (Xue et al., 2015:21). It also integrates well with the COBIT 2019 framework, an upcoming popular framework used by various companies to govern and control projects. PMBOK possess a strong communications management mechanism (Karaman & Kurt, 2015:578). PMBOK is preferred for Information Technology projects that require significant client dedication, massive and complicated project teams, outsourcing at higher rates, extensive contracts, and a prominent level of shareholder interaction (Karaman & Kurt, 2015:578).

Drawbacks

Small entities will not easily benefit from implementing PMBOK, as it is very costly and takes a considerable amount of time to implement (Xue et al., 2015:20). The PMBOK technique is the most effective for teaching each knowledge area's topic content, but it is less effective for guiding the execution of a single project. (Abdullah et al., 2021:47).

P2M

Structure/Principles

Another resource for project managers is a guidebook on Project and Program Management for Enterprise Innovation (P2M) (Abdullah et al., 2021:42). The Engineering Advancement Association of Japan created and first published it in 2003 (ENAA) (Abdullah et al., 2021:42). Goals of the Project Management Standard is made up of the eleven elements as follows: Project/Program Management, Integration and Stakeholder Management, Scope and Resource Management, Time and Cost Management, Risk and Quality management, Procurement and Communications Management (Abdullah et al., 2021:42). A business project and program management guideline derived from Japanese commercial practice manage projects and programs from the perspective of the enterprise rather than a traditional project (Peng et al., 2007:110). P2M, unlike its European counterparts, changes existing project management paradigms (Peng et al., 2007:110). P2M creates a new commercial model based on corporate, system, and application innovation (Peng et al., 2007:110). P2M emphasises applying external change to project teams (Peng et al., 2007:110). P2M also outlines the activities on project supplies, knowledge and data acquisition and broadens the area of previous project management (Peng et al., 2007:110). P2M is more focused on portfolios and programs than PMBOK, which focuses on single projects (Ghosh et al., 2012:19).

Benefits

P2M/KPM project and program management is based on a mission-driven approach and is suggested to support project management development through creating value in a complex and dynamic environment (Siang & Yih, 2012:26). It is a complete project management technique that is responsive to changing environmental conditions (Siang & Yih, 2012:26). It has been demonstrated that economic crisis survival requires flexibility, adaptability, and reformation (Siang & Yih, 2012:26). P2M/KPM techniques and methodologies have proven its value via offering learning opportunities in organizations, increasing involvement, and driving cooperation and comprehension among key leaders (Siang & Yih, 2012:26). Siang and Yih (2012:26) also state that the profitable businesses were those who used P2M/KPM tactics throughout the recession. The flexibility to adapt to environmental changes is strongly emphasised by Japanese organizations, and their models are built around this concept (Siang & Yih, 2012:29). P2M was the first big step toward actual business integration and acceptance of project and program management, and one of the first to provide patterns for allowing integration with managing programs and portfolios at enterprise level (Siang & Yih, 2012:29). P2M is already extensively utilized as a standard guide, and through its respect for other standards and unique approach to project and program management for value creation in organizations, it provides a stable framework for continued development and advancement of project management. (Siang & Yih, 2012:30).

Drawbacks

Just like any other, there is no guarantee that by implementing the standard, a program will be successful (Low, 2015:33). Many factors influence whether such projects succeed or fail (Low, 2015:33). Employees, for example, are inclined to detest and resist radical changes unless their fears and anxieties are addressed or radical changes are reasonable enough for them to accept, because environmental changes necessitate new approaches towards adaptation, such as reorganizing or reassigning employees to other positions in the workplace (Low, 2015:33). As a result, efforts are required to alleviate such issues (Low, 2015:33). When Japan's economy soured in the 1990s, modifications were made to some areas of traditional Japanese management in order to survive the recession (Low, 2015:34). Reformation was implemented, which also included layoffs, production and inventory cutbacks, and factory closures (Low, 2015:34). The conventional pay model based on seniority and lifetime employment implemented in Japan has been updated and decreased, almost ceasing to exist in certain extreme circumstances, and the Toyota group, for instance, has expanded its use of contract workers and temporary staff (Low, 2015:34). Other activities to combat the crisis included drastic adjustments or new reforms, such as joint venture arrangements with foreign corporations (Low, 2015:34). 

APMBOK

Structure/Principles

The Association for Project Management Body of Knowledge (APMBOK) from The Association for Project Management (APM), a project management professional association situated in the United Kingdom, is another prominent PM Guide (Abdullah et al., 2021:43). APMBOK is continually improved to reflect developments in the project management area, for example evolving practice patterns, changing terminology, studies, and publications (Abdullah et al., 2021:43). The Association for Project Management (APM) from the UK originally distributed the standard in 1992 (Abdullah et al., 2021:43). Since 2019, the latest version of the Guide (7th Edition) has been accessible (Abdullah et al., 2021:43). APMBOK recognises 68 knowledge domains, and each one of them is covered in a subject (Abdullah et al., 2021:43). APMBOK focuses on four sections: Organisational Perspective, Change Organisation, People and Behaviours, and Delivering Projects (Abdullah et al., 2021:43). APMBOK defines thirty technical capabilities, nine behavioural competencies, and eight contextual competencies (Ghosh et al., 2012:23). These competencies showcase a wide range of skills for a project manager, ranging from technical/application skills to social skills (interpersonal) with personnel and stakeholders (Ghosh et al., 2012:23). APMBOK includes ideas and knowledge that may only apply to specific projects, which leads to a broader approach to the expertise in project management (Ghosh et al., 2012:23). For instance, APMBOK addresses project safety, whereas PMBOK does not (Ghosh et al., 2012:23). APMBOK, conversely, covers a wider range of topics with less details, considering that detailed descriptions and approaches can be available elsewhere (Ghosh et al., 2012:23). 

Benefits

As a result of its ever-increasing and/or diminishing character, the APMBOK is more in line with modern practices than the PRINCE2 project management methodology. (Famuwagun, 2020:3). It is more thorough than other standards, such as the PMBOK (American Standard) and the IPMA Competency Baseline (Famuwagun, 2020:3). The United States, United Kingdom, Brazil and Australia employed APMBOK to as a standard to guide projects, especially with regards to managing the realisation of benefits alongside other methodologies and standards (Famuwagun, 2020:3). According to a study, APMBOK was used to identify and practise changes (67.70 – 77.00%), it was also used to manage changes (70.10 – 75.80%), it was used to conclude and embed changes to ensure the realisation of benefits (57.70 – 76.40%) and finally allowed the alignment of change strategies with project goals (57.7 – 76.40%) (Famuwagun, 2020:3). These practices was implemented by 371 project managers working on projects in Brazil, the UK and USA (Famuwagun, 2020:3). In general, APMBOK is descriptive (Famuwagun, 2020:3). APMBOK is well-suited for managing risks effectively and efficiently (Famuwagun, 2020:8). APMBOK as a standard is competent in answering questions on how to implement processes and procedures regarding project management (Famuwagun, 2020:8). APMBOK have been noted to provide project managers with miscellaneous knowledge about projects, assisting project managers in developing the necessary skills to manage projects, ensuring that projects meet the requirements of stakeholders and finally assisting the Project Team and Steering Group in maintaining a beneficial and positive relationship with respective stakeholders and authorities at all times (Famuwagun, 2020:7).

Drawbacks

Despite APMBOK’s wide coverage on a range of topics regarding project management, it lacks an in-depth description of the content (Famuwagun, 2020:3). It provides no given, methodical, and complete method for managing projects and, consequently, cannot be called a legitimate standard for project management. (Famuwagun, 2020:7). It has also been observed that APMBOK used to be unable to keep up with changing knowledge and abilities between editions in real time (e.g., the 6th edition was introduced in 2012, whilst the 7th edition was only introduced in 2019) (Famuwagun, 2020:7). Yet, due to the Internet and transformations of the digital era last-mentioned is not a problem anymore (Famuwagun, 2020:7).

chapter 8: project management methodologies

Discussion

APM

Structure/Principles

Agile Project Management (APM) is based on traditional project management concepts that are blended with flexible, lightweight, collaborative, adaptable to frequent change, yet highly disciplined processes (Salameh, 2014:55). The APM approach is built on short delivery iterations and continuous learning (Salameh, 2014:56). To kick off the project, the project team conducts simplified planning, the specification of requirements, and the design and implementation of solutions (Salameh, 2014:56). Following the kick-off, the team participates in succeeding waves of repetitions (iterations), which include more comprehensive planning, the analysis of requirements, designing processes, execution of processes, testing functionalities of projects/programs, and finally delivering the results to customers and stakeholders (Salameh, 2014:56). APM tends to be more principle-based than rule-based (Salameh, 2014:56). At each stage (iteration), needs are assessed and analysed, the APM technique allows projects to be immediately adjusted according to stakeholder requirements/new project objectives (Salameh, 2014:56). Furthermore, APM employs a feature-driven management strategy, focusing on defining the objectives and scope of a project by prioritizing a list of project features and requirements based on their value, for example, additional income or market share (Salameh, 2014:56). Consequently, a customer's engagement in the scope and analysis of the project's requirements is critical (Salameh, 2014:56). APM emphasizes collaborative development and management to provide results, customer feedback, and continual improvement and additions (Salameh, 2014:56). APM methods are highly iterative and incremental, with project team members and stakeholders actively working together to understand the project domain, define what needs to be produced, and establish priority functionality (Salameh, 2014:56). APM crept into use around a decade ago and quickly rose to become the de facto norm for managing IT projects (Salameh, 2014:57).

Benefits

APM provides the advantage of more flexibility and collaboration, which facilitates its adoption across multiple industries, including the public sector (Salameh, 2014:57). In today's corporate world, consistently changing business demands, drivers, and requirements create a challenge for project managers to manage the scope of a project, perform budgeting and proper schedule management (Salameh, 2014:58). Furthermore, business processes are becoming more complicated and intertwined than ever, and projects deal with increasingly complicated organisational constructions involving multifaceted groups, comprised of alliances with strategic suppliers, outsourcing vendors, various types of customers, partnerships, and competitors (Salameh, 2014:58). These problems highlight the importance of having a flexible and adaptable approach in order to deliver projects, products, and services faster and meet market completion and customer satisfaction requirements (Salameh, 2014:58). APM’s structure addresses these issues. APM improves management and interpersonal skills and responsiveness, velocity, adaptability, reliability, and consistency (Salameh, 2014:59). These enhancements may benefit enterprises, including cost savings, shorter delivery times, and enhanced client and customer satisfaction and retention (Salameh, 2014:59). APM initiatives were five times more effective in terms of cost and quality than traditional project management programs; additionally, APM projects had an 11-fold higher return on investment (Salameh, 2014:71). Furthermore, due to its lightweight processes that lead to effective decision making and productivity, APM has proven to be a realistic technique for handling high-risk, time-sensitive research-and-development projects (Salameh, 2014:71). The regular client interaction and early concept testing leads in speedy and market-sensitive outputs (Salameh, 2014:71). These outcomes boost customer satisfaction, which promotes customer trust, retention and commitment, and results in economic benefits such as increased sales, revenues, and overall profitability (Salameh, 2014:71).

Drawbacks

APM's key drawbacks are paperwork, interpersonal skills, experience and commitment, communication and involvement, agile roles, and team locations (Nuotilla et al., 2016:82). Except for a few high-tech research firms, public agencies and governmental organizations have been sluggish in adopting agile principles (Nuotilla et al., 2016:66). Challenges for adopting APM within smaller organisations include employees having the self-discipline and mindset to adapt to multiple roles (Nuotilla et al., 2016:67). The increased dependency on interpersonal skills and heavy focus on teamwork can affect some team members negatively (Nuotilla et al., 2016:67). Employees might also resist adapting the APM approach if they are used to traditional project management methods (Nuotilla et al., 2016:67). Management participation throughout the project life cycle can strain the management/project managers of the organisation (Nuotilla et al., 2016:67). Developers must comprehend numerous technologies as well as the company; this necessitates more senior and experienced developers (Nuotilla et al., 2016:67). When team members are replaced, knowledge transfer might be difficult due to a lack of documentation (Nuotilla et al., 2016:68). The lack of agile-developed recruitment policies makes the review and appointment process more difficult (Nuotilla et al., 2016:68). Teams that are distributed can become a huge challenge and requires proper communication tools (Nuotilla et al., 2016:68). Customers must be actively and consistently involved throughout the process, which may not always be achievable (Nuotilla et al., 2016:69). Finally, the adoption of APM can prove troublesome with legacy systems, as the integration can be complex (Nuotilla et al., 2016:69).

PRINCE2

Structure/Principles

PRojects IN Controlled Environments (PRINCE) was based on PROMPT, a project management method developed in 1975 by Simpact Systems Ltd. (Ghosh et al., 2012:11) The Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA), later renamed the Office of Government Commerce (OGC), established PRINCE in 1989 (Ghosh et al., 2012:11). Since its beginnings, it has supplanted PROMPT (Ghosh et al., 2012:11). Since 1989, it has been revised seven times (Ghosh et al., 2012:11). PRINCE2 was first released in 1996 (Ghosh et al., 2012:11). A collaboration of 150 European organizations contributed to it (Ghosh et al., 2012:11). PRINCE2's most recent edition was launched in 2009 (Ghosh et al., 2012:11). The impetus for the development of PRINCE2 was the desire to establish a standard for IT projects in the United Kingdom (Ghosh et al., 2012:11). It was one of the first standards created with IT projects (Ghosh et al., 2012:11). It is a structured but flexible process-based standard designed to increase project management effectiveness (Ghosh et al., 2012:11). PRINCE2's framework comprises four elements: seven principles, seven themes, seven processes, and tailoring to the individual needs of the project (Ghosh et al., 2012:11). The seven processes are divided into 40 activities (Ghosh et al., 2012:11). PRINCE2 achieves control in three ways: separating the project into manageable, controllable stages, controlling milestones, and defining the project team's organizational structure. Product-based planning in PRINCE2 focuses on the project's product (Ghosh et al., 2012:11). It also emphasizes quality control and change management strategies (Ghosh et al., 2012:11). PRINCE2 is considered an inadequate project management standard for small projects (Ghosh et al., 2012:17). The OGC claims that PRINCE2 can be simplified (Ghosh et al., 2012:17). This is achievable because PRINCE2 is adaptable and customizable (Ghosh et al., 2012:17). The PRINCE2 project management methodology can be applied to non-IT projects to manage and control product delivery, increase success rates, and achieve economic value (Ghosh et al., 2012:17). PRINCE2 is a process-based approach to project management that is widely used as a generic project management method that is neither a guide nor a standard (Abdullah et al., 2021:39). The seven themes of PRINCE2 are as follows: Business Case, Organisation, Quality, Plans, Risks, Change and Progress (Abdullah et al., 2021:40). PRINCE2 is based on the following principles: business justification is maintained, learn from one’s mistakes, clearly defined roles and responsibilities, stage-by-stage management, managing a project according to expectations, concentrating on products and adaption to the project environment  (Abdullah et al., 2021:40). As one can notice, PRINCE2 is more traditional by nature.

Benefits

Advantages of this project management methodology are ensuring projects are completed on time due to its dependable, organized, and structured approach to project management; and improving communication within and between the project management organization, the project initiator, the Project Board, suppliers, stakeholders, and product users (Famuwagun, 2020:6). It also aids in the demarcation of roles and responsibilities across a project, allowing the Project Board to manage by exception, ensuring that they are only involved in the project when necessary (e.g., when an event/activity exceeds agreed upon thresholds) (Famuwagun, 2020:6). Furthermore, it promotes the development of team members across a project because experience, knowledge, and skills are smoothly transferred and in real-time without any additional costs (Famuwagun, 2020:6). The Project Board and project stakeholders to concentrate solely on the end product and its delivery while simultaneously assisting them in saving time and reducing waste throughout the project lifecycle (Famuwagun, 2020:7).

Drawbacks

The challenges that face the use of the PRINCE2 methodology, amongst others, are only partially covering issues related to organizational assets, health and safety, stakeholder management, and communications and integration management during projects, having a limited capacity to manage existing and emerging risks appropriately, and not covering procurement management and conflict management at all (Famuwagun, 2020:6). Furthermore, when not understood and executed effectively, it can be unduly bureaucratic, and while its primary goal is to ensure a project fit with the business objectives of the Project Initiators, it does not outline how this is to be accomplished (Famuwagun, 2020:6). Based on the above disadvantages, PRINCE2 is not generally recommended for largescale IT projects (Famuwagun, 2020:6). According to a study, it is for this key reason that many UK government projects have failed over the years (for example, the failed NHS IT project, the scrapped eBorder project, and the failed Research Councils' Back Office Service and Process Unification project), and it has also been recorded that it is one of the reasons why 65 - 78 percent of megaprojects around the world deviated from their original business objectives at completion (Famuwagun, 2020:6). Furthermore, its stringent documentation requirements make rapid changes difficult to implement and resource re-allocation problematic (Famuwagun, 2020:6). 

SCRUM

Structure/Principles

Scrum is an agile software development process used by businesses in projects with increased end-user participation and requirements that continue to evolve until the project is completed (Khoja et al., 2010:20). Scrum operates in iterations, and each iteration is known as a sprint, which lasts 30 continuous days (Khoja et al., 2010:20). The team, the product owner, and the scrum master are the three roles in the process (Khoja et al., 2010:20). Scrum's beauty is that it believes in self-managing and self-organizing teams, and there are mechanisms in place to monitor and control the project even when the needs are ambiguous (Khoja et al., 2010:20). Few businesses keep a burn-down chart to track the time remaining between sprints (Khoja et al., 2010:20). The time to complete each sprint is fixed, however as the project becomes more complex, the functionality or quality may be reduced, but the sprint is expected to end on the agreed-upon date (Khoja et al., 2010:20). Scrum and other agile approaches are extremely compatible with quality standards such as CMMI (Khoja et al., 2010:23). Thus, the company does not need to change, but rather how it fits into the model, enhances it, and makes the best of it (Khoja et al., 2010:23). The main activities of the SCRUM methodology include product backlog refinement, during which the team estimates the items and confirms the order of significance (Obrutsky, 2015). Sprint planning entails a timed meeting that lasts around two hours per week of sprint duration (Obrutsky, 2015). A high-quality product backlog is critical to the success of sprint planning (Obrutsky, 2015). The daily Scrum is a 15-minute meeting held every day in which each team member elaborates on what they have done since the last meeting, what they plan to do between now and the next meeting, and the blockers (Obrutsky, 2015). After the sprint, there is a demonstration of the product increment (Obrutsky, 2015). The product owner updates the product backlog once the team and stakeholders examine it (Obrutsky, 2015). Finally, the sprint retrospective occurs when the team evaluates how the process was carried out, noting issues and opportunities for improvement (Obrutsky, 2015).

Benefits

Even though Scrum was created and is intended for usage in the IT industry, many of its concepts may be adapted to other areas such as engineering, finance, health care, and others (Ghosh et al., 2012:33). Every project might benefit from having its high-value base features come first, followed by additional features (Ghosh et al., 2012:33). This enables for scope changes, feedback inclusion, risk minimization, and increased customer satisfaction (Ghosh et al., 2012:33). Many firms have successfully embraced Scrum, and even more have successfully applied Scrum concepts to traditional project management models to shorten development time (Ghosh et al., 2012:33). Other advantages of implementing the Scrum project management methodology include faster delivery times of projects, thus customers can receive results much quicker (Obrutsky, 2015). Projects become more adaptable and flexible to user changes and requirements (Obrutsky, 2015). User feedback can continue throughout the whole Scrum process, enhancing communication between the team and stakeholders and ensuring proper end-delivery functionalities of projects (Obrutsky, 2015).  The user requirements are collected after each sprint, which help team members to stay on track with the project schedule and functionalities (Obrutsky, 2015). The requirements are prioritized systematically (Rao et al., 2011:42). 

Drawbacks

One of the main disadvantages of implementing a Scrum project management methodology is that the scope of a project can change constantly because users can keep adding more functionality to a project, as user requirements are collected after each sprint (Obrutsky, 2015). The Scrum methodology is more applicable to smaller companies. Larger companies with planned architectures and structures will struggle to implement the methodology properly (Obrutsky, 2015). If a team member leaves or is replaced by a junior/new member, it can decrease the team’s productivity (Obrutsky, 2015). It is also harder to implement quality controls because changes in a project are a defined constant (Obrutsky, 2015). Because the client is not always on site and close to the project team, close customer collaboration is not always possible (Rao et al., 2011:42). Documentation on the methodology is limited, an can thus sometimes become challenging to implement (Despa, 2014:52). Small teams necessitate the usage of skilled developers on a project (Despa, 2014:52). Project estimations are limited at the start of the project for large implementations, making cost estimates erroneous (Despa, 2014:52).

Statistics and Examinations



Figure 2: Comparison of various methodologies from a project management perspective (Charvat, 2003:5)



Figure 3: Agile Adoption Challenges (Anthony, 2022)





Figure 4: Project Management Failures (Cohen, 2019)



Figure 5: Project Management Approaches (Harrin, 2022)



Based on the figures above, one can deduce what project management methodologies are essential as to why projects fail and why some companies struggle to adapt to the Agile methodology. It would appear that the traditional project management methodologies can manage projects better in terms of scope, time, quality and budget. Due to their traditional approach and emphasis on architecture and structure, traditional project management methodologies are more suited for large-scale projects and large companies. However, traditional project management methodologies lack the flexibility and adaptability of Agile methodologies. Agile methodologies are more suitable for smaller and medium-sized companies, where the emphasis on structure and architecture might be non-existent. Project phases are also more prevalent in traditional methodologies than in agile methodologies. According to Figure 3, the top three reasons why projects failed in 2019 are organisations’ decisions to change their priorities, changes in project objectives and failure to understand the project functionality and requirements according to stakeholders. Even though Agile methodologies are more suited to manage current projects, many companies struggle to adapt to the methodologies to manage projects due to employees’ resistance to change management, lack of the management’s involvement, varying practises and processes that are followed by teams and different departments, instead of having one clear standard and guideline to follow. Lack of training project managers to implement the methodologies efficiently and cultural misalignment also contributes to constraints on implementing Agile methodologies. Finally, it would appear that most project managers prefer a hybrid approach to managing projects instead of respectively following a traditional or Agile approach. The more experienced project managers become, the more they follow a predictive approach than an iterative one.

chapter 10: CONCLUSION

Deductions

Based on the content of this report, the following recommendations can be made to Company XYZ as to which project management methodologies are the most applicable to implement to manage current projects while also mitigating risks and maximizing business opportunities. The hypotheses of the System Model have, in actuality, been thoroughly disproven by the research conducted. COBIT 2019 is not necessarily the best practice governance framework to implement. COBIT 2019 needs a lot of expertise to be implemented efficiently/effectively within a company, even though it provides clear standards and guidelines for managing and governing projects according to government regulations. Due to this fact and given that the COBIT 2019 documentation is quite extensive, it is not in general suited for smaller companies, which may lack the resources and personnel to implement this governance framework. Even though COBIT 2019 popularity has risen over the past few years and has been implemented by a variety of companies, it would appear that ITIL/ISO27000 is the governance framework that is still preferred as the de facto standard by project managers. COBIT 2019 is more suited for large companies whose management needs to comply with government regulations and specify business objectives and alignments alongside organisational structure and Business/IT alignments. CMM/CMMI is a good governance framework if the organisation emphasises maturity levels rather than organisation and structure/architecture. However, there have been found that smaller companies struggle to follow CMMI practices due to the framework being too costly to implement and rigid time constraints to implement the framework. The CMMI documentation is extensive and can take smaller companies a long time to finish the admin. PMBOK is a project management standard that integrates well with the COBIT 2019 framework and provides clear guidelines/best practices for managing projects. It thus works well for larger companies that need to follow government regulations and specific architecture. However, PMBOK is costly to implement and does not work well with rigid time constraints. The P2M standard works well with project management in Asian-aligned cultures, as the familiar emphasises culture and trust.

Many Western companies also started to implement the standard due to the principles of P2M. P2M is a pretty universal standard, which means it can easily be implemented in most companies to manage projects. However, P2M emphasises radical changes, and employees might resist such change management. APMBOK is also a suitable standard for managing modern projects. APMBOK is well versed in guiding project managers on how to execute and manage projects. The guidelines are quite extensive, and risk management and assessment are easy to implement within this standard. Some of the knowledge areas in APMBOK lack depth, and it might sometimes be difficult to implement the standard within companies.

Regarding project management methodologies, traditional project management methodologies, such as PRINCE2, is more suited for large-scale projects and companies due to providing structure/architecture. Agile methodologies, such as APM or Scrum, are more suited towards smaller companies where time constraints are tight, project objectives should be rapidly delivered, and requirements are improved iteratively. Agile methodologies can practically guarantee improved quality and productivity. Knowledge transfer in Agile methodologies can be troublesome though, and the ability to adapt quickly to changes can be challenging for some employees and they may eventually resist change management. The main reason projects fail is that project management teams fail to understand stakeholder requirements, processes and methodologies that are too expensive to implement/overbudgeting or mismanagement of funds on projects, and poor schedule planning/time management. Lack of communication between stakeholders/team members and lack of management’s involvement in projects have also contributed to project failures. To conclude: in reality, there does not exist a best practice project management methodology and standards. It all depends on the type of organisation, projects and the specified stakeholder requirements, and the type of architecture and organisational structure a company has.



Overall well researched.  Be careful not to follow a timeline.  Tell the story as it happened in history.  At times you build your argument on outdated reasoning, but overall you debated well and came up with some brilliant arguments.
