Simplicity counts as well.

Special cases aren't that special enough to break the rules.

Errors shall never pass ever.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

There should be one obvious way to do it.

Although that wat may not be obvious at first, unless you're Dutch.

Now is better than never. 

Although never is often better than immediately.

If the implementation is hard to code, it's most probably a bad idea.
