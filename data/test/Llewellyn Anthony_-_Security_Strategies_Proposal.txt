INTRODUCTION



According to Peltier (2001), the purpose of an information security program is to protect valuable resources of an enterprise. This includes company information, hardware and software. Enterprises should ensure that effective, well-written policies, standards and procedures for security are implemented in order to meet their business objectives. Information Security can also be defined as “the protection of information and information systems against unauthorized access or modification of information, whether in storage, processing, or transit, and against denial of service to authorized users” (De Leeuw & Bergstra, 2007). Information Security is in general based on the “CIA definition” or triad, consisting of confidentiality, integrity and availability (Lundgren & Möller, 2017). Information Security should ensure that information is not made available or disclosed to individuals that do not have the authorization to access the information. Information protected by a security program should be accurate and complete. Information should be accessible and usable by authorized personnel. 

The history of modern information security does not start in the 1960s-1970s, as most people believe. Information Security originates from 1684 in a war between the Dutch Republic and France. The French tried to invade the southern Netherlands. The Dutch captured a French messenger who tried to deliver an encoded letter to King William of the Netherlands. The French Ambassador to the Dutch Republic, Count D’ Avaux, ensured the Amsterdam town council that no one could read the letter since it required a key to be deciphered. However, about a month later a stadholder sent a decoded copy of the letter to the council, informing them of treacherous members within the counsel itself. King William claimed later that he received other copies of the decoded letter, which informed him of the French’s intentions of preventing him from sending troops to the south of the Netherlands to counter an invasion. This made King William aware of the importance of intercepting mail. He did this regularly to enable him to make strategic decisions in order to fight the French. He hired linguists, code-breakers and clerks to decipher intercepted mail. The king released plain text decrypted versions of the letters, informing the public of the treason committed by the Amsterdam town council and French interference in the internal affairs of the council. Thus, the king exposed the French information system, allowing the Dutch to remove political opponents in the government and win the war (De Leeuw & Bergstra, 2007). This piece of history outlines the devastating effect information warfare has, and why one should aim to develop an efficient information security system in order to prevent others from accessing confidential information.

Ever since then information security evolved to the point where we have advanced biometrics to protect our identities and confidential information. In the early days of computers, security was concerned only with the physical device and access to it. Early mainframe computers were used to store government records, personal information, and transactional processing. The security was to safeguard the data stored in the computers. Hence, physical access to the location was guarded and very few personnel had access to this location. Access was only achieved by authorized photo identification. The entry and exit to the computer rooms were monitored to ensure that the device, as well as the data stored in the device, was secured. During the 1960s and 1970s, telephone networks became the most common mode of communication, connecting millions of people. Due to the increasing importance of computers and the advent of time-shared systems, it was natural to consider linking the computers on the telephone networks so that information could be shared among geographically distributed networks. Since telephones were analog and computers were digital, modem (modulator and demodulator) devices were used to connect computers over telephone networks. Connecting computers and sharing information was of major interest during the early days of network computing and the security of the information became weak. This meant accessing others’ data without their permission became incredibly easy. In 1969, ARPANET was created to allow scientists to share data and access remote systems. Since many scientists shared military information on this system, limited forms of system break-ins to the network began. This led to government agencies in charge of ARPANET to create the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT): the first network security organisation in 1988. The purpose of CERT was to spread security awareness among users and find ways to mitigate security breaches. (Rao & Nayak, 2014). In the modern era, we have a variety of methodologies to ensure proper authentication and authorization are being implemented on information systems.

 KEY CONCEPTS: 

Laws: 

Rules that mandate or prohibit certain behaviour, they are drawn from ethics, which define socially acceptable behaviour (Whitman & Mattord, 2011). Goes hand in hand with regulations.

Policies: 

Collection of rules, principles, or guidelines that steer the information security actions in an organisation (Kinnunen & Siponen, 2018).

Information Security Program: 

Software protecting valuable resources of an enterprise.

Information Security Architecture: 

Mechanism to ensure that all individuals now what they are responsible for and how

they need to go about protecting those resources (Killmeyer, 2006).

Information Security Governance:

Influences the quality of strategic decision-making towards ensuring that investments in security are not wasted. Security governance involves a range of activities including adjusting organisational structures, designating roles and responsibilities, allocating resources, managing risks, measuring results, and gauging the adequacy 

of security audits and reviews (Tan et al., 2017).

Information Security Blueprint: 

Basis for design, selection and implementation of all security program elements, including policy implementation, ongoing policy management, risk management programs, education and training programs, technological controls and maintenance of the security program (Whitman & Mattord, 2011). 

Contingency Strategies: 

Plans developed by organisations to anticipate, react to, and recover from events that threaten the security of information and information assets in the organisation and, subsequently, to restore the organisation to normal modes of business operations (Whitman & Mattord, 2011).

Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS): 

An attacker sends large number of requests to a target, overloading the system and preventing it from operating normally and responding to other requests, causing the system to crash (Whitman & Mattord, 2011). A DDoS works in the same way, but the attack is launched from different locations at the same time using bots.

Brute Force Attack:

Using computer and network resources to try every password combination to gain access to systems (Whitman & Mattord, 2011).

Spoofing:

Technique used to gain unauthorized access to systems, by sending messages with a forged source IP address, to make it appear that the messages are coming from a trusted source, and tricking users into revealing confidential information (Whitman & Mattord, 2011).



BACKGROUND TO STUDY



The purpose of the study is to find the most applicable security strategy in order to protect an organisation’s assets. In order to find the most practical security strategies, one must be aware of the threats and vulnerabilities to information security and what an information security program entail. According to a survey from Safianu (2016), this was the response from users regarding cyber security: 

Table 1

 

From this survey alone one can speculate that people are not cautious to cyber vulnerabilities and threats. In order to combat unauthorized access to systems and confidential information, people must be aware of these threats. The human factor in data protection, however, are not the only threat to information security. Poorly designed security programs and obsolete hardware also pose a threat to cyber security. Safianu (2016) also lines out that common threats to information security include, but are not limited to, social engineering (installing programs from unidentified sources/logging in to unknown sites), SQL injections to gain access to organisations’ databases, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), a method where HTML/JavaScript can be injected into a web page, gaining unauthorized access to a website’s data. A lack of well-established personal security policies and inconsistency in privacy settings also contribute to unauthorized access to information systems. Other attacks include Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Brute Force, Spoofing and malicious software like viruses spreading via unidentified email attachments (Whitman & Mattord, 2011), for example. Threats to information security can also be non-technological, such as natural disasters, theft and interruption of services (Jouini et al., 2014).	

To combat these threats and vulnerabilities, a proper security strategy must be developed and implemented. Policies, blueprints, standards, architecture and proper governance must be implemented, as well as developing an efficient information security program. What does an efficient information security program entail? We need information security programs in order to address security issues. A security program helps us to ensure the security of our information assets and provides a framework for security to codify our desired security levels, and helps to assess and mitigate risks, as well as keeping the program and practices up to date (Andress & Leary, 2017). In order to understand the working of an information security program, one must understand how security programs are developed, what policies must be implemented, strategies that needs to be developed, the integration of security into an organisation, risk management and assessment, security awareness and training in the work environment, as well as information security program metrics that are being used to determine whether a security program complies to security standards and user requirements. This paper mainly focuses on the general policies, blueprints, standards, architecture and proper governance that needs to be implemented in order to develop an efficient security strategy. This paper will also explore how information security programs are designed and implemented.



PROBLEM STATEMENT



Company XYZ wants a suggested security strategy from the CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) that can be implemented within the next three to five years. As explained in the background of the study, most people are oblivious to security principles and practices. More ICT innovations face shorter life spans, faster replacement and obsolescence. Most organisations therefore struggle to manage and institutionalise information security successfully and struggle to create a sustainable security environment beneficial to human and social needs. With many organisations’ security measures failing, the CEO’s of Company XYZ are starting to demand answers. This paper proposes to answer the CEO’s demands by focusing on the general policies, blueprints, standards, architecture and proper governance that needs to be implemented in order to develop an efficient security strategy.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES



LITERATURE REVIEW

Policies

Policy guidelines is a set of nonbinding recommendations regarding

how management would like its employees to behave. Unlike the other documents that describe how employees must perform their responsibilities, employees have the freedom to choose what guidelines, if any, they will follow. Compliance with any guideline is optional. Policy writers often write the guidelines as part of the entire process. This is because as they move through the documents, there will be desired behaviours that cannot be enforced, but are desired nonetheless. These statements of desired behaviour form the basis for the guidelines. Similar to other documents, a recommended format for guideline documents include the following headings:

• Background: why the guideline exists, and what policy and standard

documents it is related to

• Scope: who requires guidelines and where are they required

• Definitions: explanations of terminology

• References: where people can look for additional information

• Coordinator/Guidelines Author: who sponsored the guidelines, and

where people go to ask questions

• Effective Date: when the standard guidelines take effect

• Review Date: when the standard guidelines get reviewed

• Guidelines Statements: what the measures and requirements are

Unlike the other documents, it is not necessary to have an approver

for a guideline. As it is typically written as part of a larger package, and

due to its nonbinding nature, there is no approving signature required (Hare, 2001).




Figure 1

This is the process that should be followed to develop a policy, according to Hare (2001). Hare (2001) describes the documentation process as the following:

The Initial and Evaluation Phase comprises of a written proposal which are submitted to management stating the objectives of the particular document (policy, standard, etc.) and the needs it should address. Management will then evaluate this request to satisfy itself that the expected benefit to the organisation justifies the expected cost. If so, a team is assembled to develop and research the document. Otherwise, the submitter is advised that no further action will take place. During the development Phase, funding is required from the organisation. A  joint team, together with management, decides on the individual who will be held responsible for approving the finished document The development team is essential to provide input on the requirements that are needed when the product or service is being developed or assembled into the finished product. Operations personnel provide the needed input to ensure that the document can be implemented once it is completed. The technical requirements are put forward, designed, and worded by the experts on the team. These people discuss and debate the issues until final wording is agreed upon. The Approval Phase begins when the team has completed the design phase, the document is presented to the appropriate body within the organisation. Some organisations will have formalized methods for approving a policy. It is necessary during the development phase to establish who the approving body or person is. The document is presented to the approving body and a discussion of the development process ensues, highlighting any reasons that the team felt were important considerations during development. The document is “balloted” by the approving body, and any negative issues should be addressed prior to approval of the document. The Publication Phase allows the translated document to be published within the organisation. At this point, the document is ready for implementation as of the effective date. In some situations, the effective date may be the date of publication. The Implementation Phase comprises of the various groups affected by the new document commencing its implementation. This implementation will be different, depending on where it is being placed into use. For example, a user’s perspective will be different from that of an operational team. While the document is being used, people should be encouraged to send their comments and questions to the coordinator. These comments will be important during the review or maintenance phase. The Maintenance Phase is where the document is reviewed on the review date. During this review, the continuing viability of the document is decided. If the document is no longer required, then it is withdrawn or cancelled. If viability is determined and changes are needed, the team jumps into the development cycle once again.

Blueprints and Standards

Blueprints are a basis for design, selection, and implementation of all security policies, education and training programs, and technological controls. It is a more detailed version of a security framework (outline of overall information security strategies for an organisation). It should specify tasks to be accomplished and the order in which they are to be realized. Blueprints should also serve as scalable, upgradeable, and comprehensive plan for information security needs for coming years. One approach to selecting a methodology is to adapt or adopt a published model or framework for information security. A framework is the basic skeletal structure within which additional detailed planning of the blueprint can be placed as it is developed of refined (Broadbent, 2015). Broadbent made a PowerPoint presentation discussing the ISO 17799/BS7799, a common information security standard, one of the most widely referenced and often discussed security models. It is a framework for information security that states organisational security policy is needed to provide management direction and support. One of the most widely referenced and often discussed security models, which was originally published as the British Standard BS 7799. This Code of Practice was adopted as an international standard by the International Organisation for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as ISO/IEC in 2000 as a framework for information security. The ISO/IEC 17799 Framework provides organisational security infrastructure objectives, such as to manage information security within the company, maintaining the security of organisational information processing facilities and information assets accessed by third parties, maintaining the security of information when the responsibility for information processing has been outsourced to another organisation. Asset classification and control is needed to maintain appropriate protection of corporate assets and to ensure that information assets receive an appropriate level of protection. The framework also attempts to reduce risks of human error, theft, fraud or misuse of facilities, ensuring that users are aware of information security threats and concerns, and are equipped to support the corporate security policy in the course of their normal work, and to minimize the damage from security incidents and malfunctions and learn from such incidents. Other priorities include the prevention of unauthorized access, damage and interference to business premises and information, to prevent loss, damage or compromise of assets and interruption to business. Control objectives include to control access to information, preventing unauthorized access to information systems, ensuring the protection of networked services, preventing unauthorized computer access, detecting unauthorized activities

and ensuring information security when using mobile computing and telecommunication networks. Compliance objectives include avoiding breaches of any criminal or civil law, statutory, regulatory or contractual obligations and of any security requirements and ensuring the compliance of systems with organisational security policies and standards. There is a lot of other frameworks and blueprints that can be implemented, but the ISO 17799/BS7799 is a general good framework to follow when designing security implementations.

Architecture

According to Killmeyer (2006), Information security architecture consists of the following components:

Identify the roles and responsibilities of key personnel throughout the organisation to implement security infrastructure.

Establish security policies, standards and procedures.

Identify strengths/weaknesses of security implementations in the organisation.

Implement a user-awareness program to make users aware of risks and consequences of the improper use of information and processing resources

Establish mechanisms to monitor the effectiveness of the security program through frequent audits and compliance testing.

Understanding laws and regulations related to securing information in the organisation

Identify alternate processing and operational plans for contingency purposes

Governance



Figure 2

According to this diagram by Kauspadiene et al. (2017), information security governance works as follow: 

The model (Figure 5) suggests that a security governance program together with the organisation’s information security office, an ongoing process of interrelated policy management activities, and the proper gauging of key external and internal influences together contribute greatly to the success of an organisation’s information security policies. The model provides unique value through its comprehensive, real-world representation of an information security policy process in modern organisations. The data used in the development of the model is rooted in the broad-based experiences of those who have been most active in developing and implementing organisational information security policies. Thus, this model provides a more complete, practice-based framework that informs organisations and researchers concerning the interactions of key processes and influences that form an effective information security policy process. In the model, information security governance is an overarching category directly affecting the entire policy management process. The organisation information security office is depicted as a category supporting the policy management phases. The internal and external influences are depicted as general influences on the entire policy management process. Internal influences include senior management support, organisation culture, technology architecture, etc. External double arrows illustrate the two-way interaction between the policy management processes and the internal and external influences. External influences include economic sector, industry standards, legal and regulatory requirements, etc. The central part of the model pictures the entice process of organisation’s security policy – it is a continuous cycle, affected by internal and external factors, where key elements are policy approval, training, implementation, monitoring, enforcement, review, risk assessment and, finally, policy development (p. 113-114).

Kauspadiene et al. (2017) provides evidence how information security governance is integrated with policy management and management frameworks (standards and blueprints) to be able to develop an efficient information security system.

Information Security Program

The following steps should be followed as proposed by Andress & Leary (2017), in order to design an efficient information security program and security strategy:

Develop the organisational vision and mission statements. It should be short, concise and to the point.

Describe the current information security environment. This is the starting point for developing a forward-looking plan and road maps. 

Develop the strategic plan. The plan should describe a pathway from current states to future states, as well as what each state is. Use strategic planning tools preferred by your organisation and develop/use a common framework to ensure that procedures and standards of the business are being followed	.

Deliver the plan through information security road maps. These maps provide a calendarized view of initiatives that support strategic goals and objectives. Each road map node will eventually become a formal project or improvement activity to drive the organisation toward its desired states.

Engage the key stakeholders for alignment and relevancy. They should continuously be updated on the plans and their support is of utmost importance since they will provide the funding and resources necessary to finalize the plan. They will help to communicate and explain the security strategy to others.

Contingency Strategies

The business impact analysis is the basis of the other contingency plans. It lists the organisation’s business functions and prioritizes them based on how critical they are to the organisation’s continued existence. The higher the prioritization of each item, the greater the need to get that aspect of the business quickly up and

running. According to the FFIEC (n.d.), the business impact analysis has four steps.

The incident response plan is designed to allow the organisation to respond to any threat to its security. These threats can include worms, Trojans, viruses, Denial-of-Service attacks etc. An incident is usually a man-made occurrence with that is directed at information systems, as opposed to life or physical property (Whitman

and Mattord, 2010). The second plan for the security of an organisation and its

data is the disaster recovery plan. The disaster recovery plan goes beyond the incident response plan in that a disaster will often have far greater financial consequences and may indeed put the lives of the organisation’s employees at stake. As such, the disaster recovery plan must be even more carefully thought out and well-planned than the incident response plan. The disaster recovery plan should deal not only with how to keep the organisation’s assets safe and secure, but its human resources as well. The third plan to protect an organisation from the

consequences of unforeseen events or disasters is the business continuity plan. This plan is implemented when the organisation has been forced to relocate from its

primary location due to a disaster. There is a great deal of risk when calling into action the business continuity plan. There will also almost inevitably be a great amount of confusion among the organisation’s employees at this critical juncture. This plan must ensure that business critical assets are relocated, and that the organisation’s people are safe and understands what is required from each of them (Clark, 2010).

Security Training and Awareness

Ensuring high information security awareness (ISA) in the organisation can directly and indirectly change employee attitudes towards information security. In practice, this is about ensuring the right mindset and making certain that people work for robust security routines instead of against them. In a case study by Eminaǧaoǧlu and colleagues (2009), it is shown that by participating in security courses and continuous security campaigns, employees start to use stronger passwords. Organisations should ensure that employees are provided with the time needed to be involved to gain better knowledge about security. The training should be separate from everyday tasks, and employees may be offered the opportunity to complete the course at their own pace. To derive the most benefits from security training, organisations should tailor the program so that all employees understand its content and importance. Security must not be regarded as a burden but part of the daily work routine. If employees have faith in their own abilities, their intention to follow information security processes will increase (Bekkevik et al., 2018).

Staff required to implement strategies

According to Peltier (2001), the following roles and responsibilities within an organisation regarding security are important:

Senior management has the ultimate responsibility for the protection of an organisation’s information assets. The CIO (Corporate Information Officer) directs day-to-day management of information assets within the company. The ISSO and Security Administrator should report directly to the CIO and are responsible for the daily administration of the information protection program. Supporting roles are performed by the service providers and systems operation team that designs and operates the computer systems. They must implement security practices on the system. Telecommunications departments are responsible for providing communication services. Information protection professionals must establish a strong relationship with the audit staff. Other employees include physical security staff and contingency planning groups. A group of people is required to ensure that the application development methodology is being implemented as well as the implementation of information protection requirements. Quality assurance group are required to ensure that all information protection requirements are involved in all projects of the organisation. Human resources are required to take appropriate actions against individual who violates any policies of the organisation.	

From this research it will be possible to compile a recommended security strategy for Company XYZ.



EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



Based on the research being done, a final security strategy will be proposed to Company XYZ. In order to implement an efficient security strategy, one has to be aware of the correlations between information security policies, blueprints, standards, architecture and governance. The best general security strategy to implement, when designed from scratch, has to focus on each of the abovementioned components. One has to be aware of threats to your information system and have contingencies in place for possible attacks or incidents. Each policy within the organisation has to be carefully structured and planned, following the processes as proposed by Hare (2001). Proper governance of information security systems is required, and different staff members are required to ensure that a security strategy are successfully implemented. The management of the company must decide on a framework to use within the company (such as the ISO   17799/BS7799 or NIST SP 800-14) and comply to all the framework’s standards and procedures. A culture of security must be established in the work environment, by making use of security training and awareness. Employees must be allowed to complete security courses on their own time, to avoid being rushed and thus fail to comply to security protocols within the organisation. Proper contingency strategies must be put in place in order to avoid the loss of assets (information) and alternative routes should be followed in order to secure the assets and passing information on. 

Laws and regulations on information security should be complied to at all times. Another good source to reference is an article by Nelson & Sharma (2018) on proposed biometrics for future security. To conclude, the main aim of an information security strategy is to protect a business’s assets and confidential information.
