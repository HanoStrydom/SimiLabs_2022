CHAPTER 1  PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Mr Thys Taljaard of the Instrument-makers on the North-West University Potchefstroom Campus has asked for advice regarding their technological architecture as they are experiencing difficulties with the services provided by the university’s information technology (IT) services. A technical architecture will be planned after which Mr Taljaard will choose one of the solutions provided and that solution will be implemented. 
CHAPTER 2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION AND BACKGROUND
On the NWU Potchefstroom Campus, the instrument makers have a management system with a database. Due to the system's malfunction, it is not presently in use. The system is a desktop programme, and university IT services host and manage the database. The department head has requested guidance on how to handle this system from an IT architecture standpoint. The NWU server is now used for electronic messaging, data storage, and file sharing in the present design. The Potchefstroom Campus is home to the NWU server that the Instrument-makers utilise. IT services on campus are in charge of managing it. Because the campus's IT systems are overloaded, Mr Taljaard has noted difficulties with the current environment. 
The server and database utilised by the administration system are managed by IT specialists, which is a benefit of the existing architecture. By implementing cloud services, their architecture may become only partially dependent on NWU IT services. If Mr Taljaard decides to employ cloud services, the administrative system's database as well as the system itself will be hosted in the cloud and not managed by the NWU. The drawbacks of this might include increased expenditures and, should the need arise, a lack of technical assistance.
CHAPTER 3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
1 Aims
The goal of this research is to choose the optimal technological architecture for the case study's micro-enterprise. In order to choose the best technological architecture, the research will examine several enterprise architectural components and architectures while referring to Mr Taljaard's needs.
2 Objectives
To find the most affordable and user-friendly architecture available to small businesses, investigations will be carried out. Additionally, it will be investigated to see whether the end users would feel at ease utilising the selected architecture and to see if they will require training to do so.
When several architectures have been selected, Mr Thys Taljaard will be given various solutions and counselled on which to select. The ultimate decision on the architecture to adopt will be made by Mr Taljaard. Following the implementation of the selected design, end-user input will be gathered and analysed to assess the architecture's success.
The literature studies that will be discussed are the following:
(a) Enterprise architecture for small and medium-sized enterprises by Berneart et al. This book is about how to introduce EA into SMEs based on existing adoption models.
(b) User acceptance of computer technology by Davis et al. In this article two theoretical models are discussed, namely the Technology Acceptance Model and the Method Evaluation Model.
(c) Enterprise architecture at work by Lankhorst. This book discusses how EA is implemented and managed within an organisation.
(d) The TOGAF Standard by The Open Group is the international standard for frameworks of EA.
(e) Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Power Platform, and Google Cloud are used to determine what each offers in terms of architecture.
CHAPTER 3 LITERATURE REVIEW
3 Introduction
To create a technical architecture, you have to look at enterprise architecture as a whole and understand what each component does and how the components work together. This literature review will define what enterprise architecture is, how it relates to small businesses, what the international standard is for enterprise architecture, and what existing solutions are available. 
4 Discussion of related literature
4.1 Bridging the gap between SMEs and EA
Bernaert et al. (2014) give three adoption models to use to implement EA in SMEs, namely the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Method Evaluation Model, and Methodological Pragmatism. 
Davis et al. (1989) introduced the TAM as a measurement scale for forecasting the user acceptance of technology, using perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Studies done by Davis et al. (1989) showed that users prefer an application that provides the exact functionality they desire over ease of use, which is still true today as proven by studies done by Sheppard and Vibert (2019). These studies show the importance of an application adhering to a user’s functional requirements. The application should be made to do exactly what a user wants. The functional capabilities of an EA are therefore very important when planning the technical architecture, as each component within the technical architecture should take into account what the functional capabilities are.
Methodological Pragmatism assumes that a method is either effective or ineffective, it cannot be correct or wrong (Bernaert et al., 2014:83). Bernaert et al. (2014) state that all methods are intended to increase a task’s performance by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the task. The efficiency can be improved by reducing inputs, and the effectiveness by improving the outputs (Bernaert et al., 2014:83).
Moody (2003) created a theoretical model and related measuring instrument based on TAM and Methodological Pragmatism that evaluates methods based on certain constructs: actual efficiency, actual effectiveness, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, intention to use, and actual usage. This evaluation method is called the Method Evaluation Model. 
Using the TAM and the Method Evaluation Model, EA can be adopted by SMEs by performing three tasks: increasing the perceived usefulness, increasing the perceived ease of use, and making sure the actual efficacy influences the perceived efficacy. Actual efficacy has an impact on perceived usefulness, and actual efficiency has an impact on perceived ease of use (Bernaert et al., 2014:86). TAM’s scale may be used to evaluate perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use (Bernaert et al., 2014:86). Developing EA techniques should be implemented and tested to improve the techniques (Bernaert et al., 2014:87). If the actual efficacy meets the user’s standards, the perceived usefulness will increase as the user will spread the positive impact EA has on SMEs (Bernaert et al., 2014:87).
4.2 Architecture and enterprise architecture
The ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 standard is the internationally accepted standard for information systems. It  (ISO & IEC, 2011:2) defines the term architecture as “fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships, and in the principles of its design and evolution.” Lankhorst (2009:2) compares the architecture of an information system in an organisation to the architecture blueprints used to design and build a building. Lankhorst (2009:2) states that the frame of reference when designing an architecture for a building is similar to what is needed when designing an architecture for an enterprise. The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) is an internationally recognised framework for designing architectures within organisations (The Open Group, 2018:xix). TOGAF will be discussed in more detail in a further section. The Open Group (2018:6) gives the following definition for an enterprise: “any collection of organizations that have common goals.” Combining what architecture and an enterprise are, the following definition can be given to enterprise architecture (Lankhorst, 2009:3): “a coherent whole of principles, methods, and models that are used in the design and realisation of an enterprise’s organisational structure, business processes, information systems, and infrastructure.”
Enterprise architecture is a management and technology approach focused on helping businesses improve their performance by allowing them to understand themselves holistically and integrated in terms of their strategic direction, business processes, information flows, and technological resources (Scott A. Bernard, 2012:23). A company may manage the changeover from the present to the future operational states by creating current and future versions of this integrated view (Scott A. Bernard, 2012:23).
4.3 The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)
As stated above, TOGAF is a widely accepted framework for creating organisational architectures (The Open Group, 2018:xix). The TOGAF document is divided into five parts: the Architecture Development Method (ADM), ADM guidelines and techniques, the Architecture Content Framework, the Enterprise continuum and tools, and the Architecture Capability Framework (The Open Group, 2018:5). The TOGAF Standard supports the following common architecture domains: business architecture, data architecture, application architecture, and technology architecture (The Open Group, 2018:11-12).
4.4 Enterprise architecture principles
Principles are broad rules and guidelines that inform and support how an organisation approaches achieving its objective (The Open Group, 2018:197). They are meant to be durable and rarely changed (The Open Group, 2018:197). Principles may be simply one component of an organised collection of concepts that collectively define and direct the organisation, from values to actions and outcomes (The Open Group, 2018:197). Principles may be created at various levels and within various areas, depending on the organisation (The Open Group, 2018:197).
The creation and application of architecture are influenced by two important domains (The Open Group, 2018:197):
· Enterprise Principles offer a foundation for corporate decision-making and guide the organization's approach to achieving its purpose.
· Architecture Principles are a collection of rules that govern how architecture operates.
4.4.1 Common Architecture Principles
A rigid architecture may become less flexible if there are too many principles (The Open Group, 2018:201). Many companies prefer to keep the number of principles to between 10 and 20 and to only designate high-level ones (The Open Group, 2018:201).
The following principles are common principles used in organisations when developing an architecture:
Business principles (The Open Group, 2018:201-204):
· Primacy of principles: all enterprises within the organization must adhere to these information management guidelines.
· Maximise benefit to the enterprise: the enterprise as a whole is considered while making information management decisions to maximise benefits.
· Information management is everybody’s business: the enterprise as a whole participates in information management choices necessary to achieve business objectives.
· Business continuity: despite system outages, business activities are kept up.
· Common use applications: it is preferable to create enterprise-wide apps rather than create identical or redundant applications that are only offered to one entity.
· Service orientation: the architecture is centred on the creation of services that are designed to reflect the actual business operations that make up enterprise business processes.
· Compliance with law: processes for enterprise information management abide by all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
· Information technology (IT) responsibility: ownership and implementation of IT processes and infrastructure that enables solutions to satisfy user-defined objectives for functionality, service levels, pricing, and delivery schedules within the scope of the IT organisation.
· Protection of intellectual property: intellectual property (IP) belonging to the business must be safeguarded. The IT architecture, implementation, and governance procedures must reflect this protection.
Data principles (The Open Group, 2018:205-209):
· Data is an asset: data is an asset that the organisation values and is managed as such.
· Data is shared: users have access to the information they need to carry out their tasks, thus data is exchanged throughout business departments and organisations.
· Data is accessible: users can obtain data to carry out their tasks.
· Data trustee: a trustee is responsible for the accuracy of each data element.
· Common vocabulary and data definitions: the definitions of data are available to all users and are uniform across the whole organisation.
· Data security: data is secured from misuse and disclosure by unauthorised parties. This includes, but is not limited to, the protection of pre-decisional, sensitive, source selection-sensitive, and proprietary information in addition to the conventional features of national security classification.
Application principles (The Open Group, 2018:209-210):
· Technology independence: applications may run on a range of technology platforms since they are independent of particular technological decisions.
· Ease-of-use: utilising applications is simple. Users are unaware of the underlying technology, allowing them to focus on their current work.
Technology principles (The Open Group, 2018:210-212):
· Requirements-based change: applications and technological advancements are only produced in response to business requirements.
· Responsive change management: enterprise information environment modifications are applied promptly.
· Control technical diversity: to keep the non-trivial cost of keeping knowledge of and communication across various processing environments to a minimum, technological variety is regulated.
· Interoperability: Standards that support data, application, and technological interoperability should be adhered to by software and hardware.
4.5 Architecture Development Method (ADM)
The ADM provides a tried-and-true method for creating architectures and establishes an architectural framework, creates architecture content, transitions, and controls how architectures are realised (The Open Group, 2018:12). All of these tasks are completed as part of an iterative cycle for the continual creation and realisation of architecture, which enables companies to alter their businesses in a controlled way in response to opportunities and goals for the company (The Open Group, 2018:12). 
There are ten phases within the ADM (The Open Group, 2018:12):
· The preliminary phase outlines the preparatory and initiatory steps necessary to develop an architecture capability, such as customising the TOGAF framework and defining the architecture principles.
· Architecture vision: The first stage of an architectural development cycle is described by this phase. It contains details on defining the project's scope, identifying the stakeholders, developing the architectural vision, and getting approval to move on with the architecture development.
· Business architecture: explains how business architecture is developed to support the agreed-upon architecture vision.
· Information systems architecture: explains how an information systems architecture is developed to support the agreed-upon architecture vision.
· Technology architecture: explains how a technology architecture is developed to support the agreed-upon architecture vision.
· Opportunities and solutions: identify delivery vehicles and carries out early implementation planning for the architecture that was developed in the earlier phases.
· Migration planning: by completing a thorough Implementation and Migration Plan, this phase addresses how to transition from the Baseline to the Target Architectures.
· Implementation governance: gives an architectural review on the execution.
· Architecture change management: creates guidelines for managing the transition to the new architecture.
· Requirements management: explores how architecture needs are managed across the ADM.
4.6 Architecture Content Framework
As a result of their work, architects implementing the ADM will create a variety of outputs (The Open Group, 2018:13). Major work products may be created, organised, and presented consistently thanks to the TOGAF Architecture Content Framework, which offers a structural model for architectural content (The Open Group, 2018:13). The three categories listed below are used by the Architecture Content Framework to categorise different types of architectural work products according to their intended use (The Open Group, 2018:13): 
· A deliverable is a piece of work that is contractually required and is afterwards formally approved by the stakeholders.
· An artefact is a piece of architectural work that explains a particular feature of architecture.
· When integrated with other building blocks to create designs and solutions, a building block represents a (perhaps reusable) component of corporate capabilities.
4.7 Enterprise continuum
The Enterprise Continuum idea is part of the TOGAF standard and illustrates how generic solutions may be used and tailored to meet the needs of a specific business (The Open Group, 2018:15). It also provides a larger perspective for architects (The Open Group, 2018:15). As foundation architectures transition from being general to being organization-specific, the Enterprise Continuum, a perspective of the Architectural Repository, offers techniques for categorising architecture and solution artefacts (The Open Group, 2018:15). The Architecture Continuum and the Solutions Continuum are two complementary ideas that make up the Enterprise Continuum (The Open Group, 2018:15).
4.8 Architecture repository
The idea of an architecture repository, developed by the ADM and capable of storing various kinds of architectural output at various levels of abstraction, supports the enterprise continuum (The Open Group, 2018:15). The TOGAF standard helps stakeholders and practitioners at all levels communicate and work together in this way (The Open Group, 2018:15).
The following are the main elements of an architecture repository (The Open Group, 2018:17):
· The Architectural Metamodel, which also includes a metamodel for architecture content, illustrates how an architecture framework might be used organisationally.
· The criteria, structures, and procedures that support the governance of the Architecture Repository are defined by the Architecture Capability.
· The architectural representation of assets deployed throughout the running enterprise at a certain moment in time is known as the architecture landscape. The landscape is likely to exist at numerous levels of abstraction to meet various design objectives.
· The standards that new architectures must adhere to are recorded in the Standards Information Base, which may comprise industry standards, carefully chosen goods and services from vendors, or shared services that have previously been implemented inside the business.
· The Reference Library offers standards, templates, patterns, and other types of reference content that may be used to hasten the development of new corporate architectures.
· The Governance Log keeps track of governance activity throughout the company.
· All permitted architectural needs that have been approved by the Architecture Board are visible in the Architecture Requirements Repository.
· The SBBs that the company has planned or implemented to support the Architecture Landscape are represented architecturally in the Solutions Landscape.
4.9 Cloud versus on site
A business has two options for data storage: cloud storage or on-site storage. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. A business should weigh each carefully to decide which to use. Below is a comparison of cloud storage and on-site storage with eight factors that should be considered when choosing which type of storage to implement (Diamond, 2020):

Cloud storage
On-site storage
Costs and maintenance
Monthly subscription costs include licensing fees and maintenance. Overall not expensive.
A large amount of upfront capital with maintenance costs thereafter. Generally very expensive.
Security/threat protection
Security is included with a monthly subscription. Cloud storage is very safe and secure.
Requires experts to create a security system.
Compliance 
Top cloud providers have teams who specialise in compliance.
Specialised knowledge is required to make sure the server is compliant with regulations.
Scalability 
Scaling up is almost instantaneous.
It is expensive to expand the server.
Reliability
An internet connection is needed to access the cloud storage. The server can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.
The server does not need an internet connection to work, which means employees have to be on-site to use it.
Data backup
Cloud providers have many features to avoid data loss.
Data loss is a big risk. 
Table 41 Comparison of cloud storage and on-site storage
Cloud storage is a better option than on-site storage. It is less expensive, requires no expertise, and carries a lower risk.
4.10 Cloud storage solutions
A cloud computing provider who maintains and runs data storage as a service provides cloud storage, which is a cloud computing model that saves data on the Internet (AWS, 2022a). It eliminates the need to purchase and manage your own data storage infrastructure because it is offered on demand with just-in-time capacity and pricing (AWS, 2022a). You get flexibility, durability, and "anytime, anywhere" data access as a result (AWS, 2022a).
A third-party cloud provider sells cloud storage, which is owned and operated by them and delivered over the Internet using a pay-as-you-go business model (AWS, 2022a). The volume, security, and durability of your data are managed by these cloud storage providers so that it is available to your applications from anywhere in the world with Internet access (AWS, 2022a). Applications can directly use an API to access cloud storage or use conventional storage protocols (AWS, 2022a). In order to gather, manage, protect, and analyse data at scale, several vendors offer complementary services (AWS, 2022a).
With cloud storage, there is no need to invest money in hardware, storage, or future scenarios that might not occur (AWS, 2022a). Users may instantly alter performance and retention parameters, add or remove capacity as needed, and only pay for storage that they use (AWS, 2022a). Even more efficiencies can be achieved by automatically moving less-used data to lower cost levels in compliance with auditable standards (AWS, 2022a).
Types of cloud storage (AWS, 2022a):
· Object storage: The enormous scalability and metadata features of object storage are frequently utilised by applications created on the cloud. Object storage options like Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) are excellent for developing scale-and-flexibility-required modern applications from the ground up. They may also be used to import pre-existing data stores for analytics, backup, or archiving purposes.
· Block storage: Dedicated, low latency storage is frequently needed for each host by other enterprise applications like databases or ERP systems. This is comparable to a Storage Area Network (SAN) or direct-attached storage (DAS) (SAN). Each virtual server is equipped with block-based cloud storage options like Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), which provide the extremely low latency needed for high-performance workloads.
4.10.1 Microsoft Power Platform
Microsoft Power Apps is a collection of apps, services, connectors, and a data platform that offers a quick development environment for creating unique apps for an organisation's requirements (Microsoft, 2022a). Users can easily create unique business apps with Power Apps that link to the data held in the underlying data platform or a variety of online and on-premises data sources (Microsoft, 2022a).
Power Apps-created applications offer robust business logic and workflow features to convert manual business processes into digital, automated ones (Microsoft, 2022a). Additionally, Power Apps-created apps have a responsive design and can function flawlessly on mobile devices and in browsers (Microsoft, 2022a). Power Apps "democratises" the process of constructing unique, feature-rich business apps by allowing consumers to do it without writing any code (Microsoft, 2022a).
Power Apps is a high-productivity platform for developing business apps, and it consists of four main parts, namely: canvas apps, model-driven apps, portals, and Microsoft Dataverse (Microsoft, 2022a).
With the power of a blank canvas, canvas applications begin with the user experience, creating a highly customised interface and linking it to the user’s choice of more than 200 data sources (Microsoft, 2022a). Canvas apps can be created for use on the web, mobile devices, and tablets (Microsoft, 2022a).
Model-driven apps begin with a data model, modelling forms, views, and other components based on the structure of the core business data and processes in the Dataverse (Microsoft, 2022a). When a user develops a model-driven app, they can quickly set up their forms, business rules, and process flows by utilising the full power of the Dataverse (Microsoft, 2022a).
With the use of portals, a user may build websites with an external audience that let visitors from outside the organisation join up using a variety of identities, produce and view data in Dataverse, or even browse material anonymously (Microsoft, 2022a). 
The data platform included with Power Apps, called Dataverse, enables the user to model and store business data (Microsoft, 2022a). The user can use Dataverse to safely store and manage data in a collection of pre-built and custom tables, and they may add columns as they need them (Microsoft, 2022a). 
Microsoft Power Apps has three pricing plans (Microsoft, 2022b):

Table 42 Microsoft Power Apps Pricing
Microsoft Power Platform is a good solution to use as it is not expensive and easy to use.
4.10.2 Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Amazon's cloud computing platform, AWS, is extensive and constantly expanding (AWS, 2022b). It combines infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and packaged software as a service (SaaS) products (AWS, 2022b). An enterprise may benefit from AWS services by receiving resources like computing power, database storage, and content delivery services (AWS, 2022b).
In order to manage its online retail activities, Amazon.com constructed internal infrastructure, which was used to launch AWS in 2006 (AWS, 2022b). AWS was among the first businesses to provide a pay-as-you-go cloud computing model that grows to give consumers access to computation, storage, or throughput as required (AWS, 2022b). AWS provides a wide range of products and services for businesses and software developers that may be used in data centres in up to 190 different nations (AWS, 2022b).
AWS is divided into many services, each of which may be customised based on the requirements of the user (AWS, 2022b). The portfolio of AWS includes more than 100 services, such as those for computing, databases, managing infrastructure, developing applications, and security (AWS, 2022b).
4.10.2.1 Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
Scalability, data accessibility, security, and speed are all features of the object storage service known as Amazon S3 (AWS, 2022c). Customers may store and safeguard nearly any quantity of data for usage in data lakes, cloud-native applications, and mobile apps, among other use cases (AWS, 2022c). You may reduce expenses, organise data, and set up precise access controls to satisfy unique business, organisational, and compliance requirements using cost-effective storage classes and simple administration tools (AWS, 2022c).
The price a user pays for storing objects in an S3 bucket is determined by the size, duration, and storage class of your items during a month (AWS, 2022c):

Table 43 Amazon Simple Storage Service Pricing
4.10.2.2 Amazon RDS for SQL Server
It is simple to set up, run, and grow SQL Server deployments in the cloud with Amazon RDS for SQL Server (AWS, 2022d). With affordable and scalable computational resources, Amazon RDS enables the quick deployment of numerous SQL Server versions. Amazon Relational Database Service oversees all aspects of Amazon RDS for SQL Server (AWS, 2022d). The administration of databases, including hardware supply, software patching, setup, configuration, and backups, does not need to be managed by the user (AWS, 2022d). Amazon RDS also offers automated backups of database instances, auto-scaling of instance storage, and makes migration easy (AWS, 2022d).
Amazon RDS offers up to 16 TB of associated storage for a user’s primary data set for each DB Instance class (AWS, 2022d). General Purpose (SSD) Storage is rated at $0.151 per GB-month (AWS, 2022d). Backup Storage for a database instance is rated at $0.113 GB-month (AWS, 2022d). 
4.10.3 Google Cloud Storage
Your objects can be stored in Google Cloud using the service known as cloud storage (Google, 2022a). A file in any format that makes up an object is an immutable piece of data. In bucket-style containers, you store items (Google, 2022a). Each bucket has a corresponding project, and you may organise your projects into groups called organisations (Google, 2022a).
