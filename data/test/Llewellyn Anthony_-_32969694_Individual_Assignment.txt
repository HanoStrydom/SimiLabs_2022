About the company:

Microsoft Corporation is a technology company, one of the biggest tech giants of the century. The company develops, licenses, and supports a range of software products, services and devices. It includes productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud and more personal computing. The company's products include operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers. (Reuters n.d.)

Organization and Management Structure:

According to Lombardo (2018), the layout of Microsoft’s organizational structure looks as follow:

Microsoft Corporation has a product type divisional organizational structure. This structure involves divisions that are based on certain computer hardware and software products, or organizational outputs. The following are the product type divisions in Microsoft’s corporate structure: productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, more personal computing etc. Global corporate groups are a secondary characteristic that defines Microsoft’s organizational structure. These groups are based on the functions essential in the computer technology business. There are 13 global corporate groups in Microsoft’s organizational structure, which includes Finances, Human Resources Management, Marketing, Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise Group as well as Corporate Strategy and Operations.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS WITHIN MICROSOFT

Information Systems

The Microsoft Company applies Management Information Systems (MIS) in dealing with internal affairs of the company. An Office Automation System (OAS) improves the productivity of employees who need to process data and information (Bill 2006). Apart from these two systems of information, the other systems of information applicable by the Microsoft Company is the use of Decision Support Systems commonly known as DSS. A decision support system enables the management to make decisions in situations surrounded by uncertainty (Maingi, 2011).

According to Maingi (2011), the MIS can be analyzed as followed:

With a relational database such as an SQL Server, the Microsoft Company uses MIS to develop Custom Information Systems (CIS). The development of custom information systems enables data linking during its entry, which thus enables cross-referencing with various reports and finally turns the information into valuable and useful information. Collection and analysis of information is possible with a well-developed data model, and the well-developed data model enables the company to understand their clients as well as being in a state to predict and tell market trends and future sales of the company (Bill 2006). Tailoring of software to the exact requirements of the company is possible, and the company is also capable of using and providing in-depth administrative reports and charts them. The Microsoft Company also uses MIS to link various existing database software as Sage and MySQL to create various comprehensive reports. The company can also use MIS to carry out questionnaire analysis using Access software, together with Microsoft Word and Excel (Bill 2006). The staff at Microsoft are also capable of easily managing all completed process of questionnaire creation through logging contacts with respondents, as well as exporting and importing reports within the questionnaire.

System Methodologies

Microsoft was dealing with an abundance of issues in early 2000’s utilizing the Waterfall methodology in their product development. Aaron Bjork, a group program manager in Microsoft’s Developer Division, postulated that the move away from Waterfall was largely driven by commercial necessity, where Microsoft needed to move smarter and faster while focusing on their customers if they were going to remain relevant. Many startups and some of Microsoft’s peers – including Google, IBM, and Apple – were already using Agile and Scrum to guide software development projects with success.



Figure 1, Disruptr (2018)

The primary benefits of using Agile over Waterfall include greater ROI with incremental return, faster time to market with greater adaptability, greater visibility, and higher quality. A new Microsoft has emerged, all thanks to Aaron and his team embracing Agile. And now Microsoft can focus on delivering better products to their customers, as well as enabling their organization to be nimble enough to lead their markets and destroy the competition once again. (Disruptr 2018)

Project Management Approaches

Policies such as needing a firm budget, benefits realization statement, and target date before a project can be approved are important (but not really agile). Similarly, organizational implementation policies needing to be followed to ensure there are no impacts to existing operations is critical (but is definitely not agile). As a result, many organizations are struggling with how to preserve some key “traditional processes” while adapting to iterative methods. The answer is a hybrid delivery model. Parts of the project can be delivered using traditional management methods, and others can be iterative. (Microsoft.com n.d.) This hybrid model is suggested by Steve Caseley.

Information System Security

According to clearpathit.com (n.d.), Microsoft implements the following security measures:

Windows Defender Antivirus program which could block known threats on user’s devices. Microsoft also has the Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection program that can detect, investigate, and respond to new or unknown threats using the power of AI – eventually mitigating the infection on personal devices. Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection allows for a reputation check, making sure that the URLs you’re clicking on are legitimate. This can be a great way to safeguard employees from phishing attacks. This also comes with Multifactor Authentication that is specifically designed to prevent hackers from logging in to the potential victim’s account. This is a perfect way to protect users from identity theft. Requiring the device to be compliant also helps prevent the spread of malware from one infected device to another. Microsoft has the Office 365 Cloud App Security which spots abnormal behaviour. This means it can prevent intentional data leakage and seal off that loophole. To protect the data itself, Microsoft has Azure Information Protection which allows for policy controls to be put in place ensuring that only certain people can view these files. Intune, a security management tool, also allows users to create conditional access rules in their device around the data itself. This ensures the safety of data in the case of a lost device or attempted login from unknown PCs. An untrusted device wouldn’t be able to access files protected by Intune.

Social Media

According to the Microsoft Business Team, the Microsoft Customer Experience Center is the foundation of their social strategy, sifting through the social chatter to identify opportunities to engage with customers in compelling and authentic ways. Driven by the social media engagement platform, Sprinklr, combined with tools such as Microsoft Power BI, Office 365 and SQL Server, a team of over 50 people manage each Microsoft product presence by listening, planning, engaging, and driving paid media across over 160 channels. With Sprinklr, Microsoft’s Customer Experience Center team can quickly navigate and monitor their audience’s social engagements based on keyword searches that create engagement queries for community managers. And as more and more conversations and relationships are created with audiences, by integrating Sprinklr with Power BI, the Customer Experience Center management team can visualize real-time breaking trends across all channels.

IS/IT ARCHITECTURAL ASPECTS OF MICROSOFT

	Network Layers and Technologies



Figure 2, Microsoft Docs

The Microsoft Windows operating systems use a network architecture that is based on the seven-layer networking model developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Each layer offers specific services to higher layers while shielding these layers from the details of how the services are implemented. A well-defined interface between each pair of adjacent layers defines the services offered by the lower layer to the higher one and how those services are accessed. Microsoft Windows network drivers implement the bottom four layers of the OSI model. The layers consist of the following:

Physical - lowest layer of OSI model. Manages the reception and transmission of the unstructured raw bit stream over a physical medium.

Data Link - sends frames between physical addresses and is responsible for error detection and recovery occurring in the physical layer.

MAC - manages access to the physical layer, checks frame errors, and manages address recognition of received frames

LLC - provides error-free transfer of data frames from one node to another. The LLC sublayer establishes and terminates logical links, controls frame flow, sequences frames, acknowledges frames, and retransmits unacknowledged frames.

Network - controls the operation of the subnet. This layer determines the physical path that the data should take, based on network conditions, priority of service and traffic control, amongst other factors.

Transport - ensures that messages are delivered error free, in sequence, and with no loss or duplication. This layer relieves the higher-layer protocols from being concerned about data transfer with their peers.

Servers

Microsoft Windows Server OS (operating system) is a series of enterprise-class server operating systems designed to share services with multiple users and provide extensive administrative control of data storage, applications, and corporate networks. Later iterations of Windows Server can be deployed either on hardware in an organization's data center or on a cloud platform, such as Microsoft Azure. Key features in later versions of Windows Server include Active Directory, which automates the management of user data, security and distributed resources, and enables interoperation with other directories, and Server Manager, which is a utility to administer server roles and make configuration changes to local or remote machines. (TechTarget n.d.)

DBMS

SQL Server is Microsoft's relational database management system. The software’s function is to manage multiple databases. It also provides a suite of tools that help to build, change, and manage the data. Additionally, there are tools for report writing, data import/export, and data analysis tools. There are different versions of SQL Server, consisting of Enterprise, Standard, Workgroup, Developer and Express, amongst others.  (Study.com n.d.)

System Software used to develop Systems

According to umsl.edu, systems software are programs that manage the resources of the computer system and simplify applications programming. They include software such as the operating system, database management systems, networking software, translators, and software utilities. Microsoft is well known for their Windows Operating System, with the latest version Windows 10 dominating the market. As abovementioned, Microsoft make use of SQL Server as their DBMS, to manage their data and use data analytics to make business decisions. Microsoft Azure is Microsoft's cloud platform: a growing collection of integrated services - compute, storage, data, networking, and apps - that help people to move faster, do more, and save money. Microsoft's approach to software defined networking includes designing, building, and operating global-scale datacenter networks for services like Microsoft Azure. Microsoft Azure global datacenters perform tens of thousands of network changes every day, which is possible only because of software defined networking. (Microsoft Docs n.d.)

OTHER ASPECTS OF MICROSOFT

Security

By implementing Zero Trust, Microsoft takes a layered approach to secure corporate and customer data. Microsoft’s phased implementation of Zero Trust centers on strong user identity, device health verification, validation of application health, and secure, least-privilege access to corporate resources and services. Zero Trust helps secure corporate resources by eliminating unknown and unmanaged devices and limiting lateral movement. Implementing a true Zero Trust model requires that all components—user identity, device, network, and applications—be validated and proven trustworthy. Zero Trust verifies identity and device health prior to granting access to corporate resources. When access is granted, applying the principle of least privilege limits user access to only those resources that are explicitly authorized for each user, thus reducing the risk of lateral movement within the environment. (Microsoft.com 2019)

Backups



The Windows Backup (Microsoft Backup) utility helps you create a copy of the information on your hard disk. If it happens that the original data on the hard disk is accidentally erased or overwritten, or becomes inaccessible because of a hard disk malfunction, one can use the copy to restore your lost or damaged data. Windows Backup utility helps to protect data from accidental loss. Windows Backup creates a duplicate copy of the data on the hard disk and then archive the data on another storage device. The backup storage medium can be a logical drive such as your hard drive, or a separate storage device such as a removable disk, or an entire library of disks or tapes organized into a media poo. Microsoft also make use of Azure Backup to make backups of data that gets stored in the cloud. (Argentum n.d.)

Communication between Stakeholders

Microsoft communicate with stakeholders, specifically customers, via online feedback, support communities, product satisfaction surveys, usability studies, research forums, business account managers and our customer service representatives

Competitive Advantage

The main implication of Microsoft Corporation’s organizational structure is the ability to focus on its product development. For example, the company uses its Intelligent Cloud division to offer cutting-edge cloud computing services. A corresponding advantage of this corporate structure is its contribution to the competitiveness of Microsoft’s products. (Panmore Institute 2018)
