Simplicity counts as well.Special cases aren't that special enough to break the rules.Errors shall never pass ever.In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.There should be one obvious way to do it.Although that wat may not be obvious at first, unless you're Dutch.Now is better than never. Although never is often better than immediately.If the implementation is hard to code, it's most probably a bad idea.
Simplicity is also important.Special circumstances do not warrant exceptions to the norms.Errors will never pass ever.When faced with uncertainty, resist the impulse to speculate.There should be a single clear solution.Unless you are Dutch, this wat may not be clear at first.Now is preferable than later.Although never is often preferable than immediately.If the implementation is difficult to program, it is most likely a terrible concept.
